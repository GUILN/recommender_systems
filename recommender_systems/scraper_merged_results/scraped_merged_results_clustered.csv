","Recommender systems (RSs) have become an inseparable part of our everyday lives. They help us find our favorite items to purchase, our friends on social networks, and our favorite movies to watch. Traditionally, the recommendation problem was considered to be a classification or prediction problem, but it is now widely agreed that formulating it as a sequential decision problem can better reflect the user-system interaction. Therefore, it can be formulated as a Markov decision process (MDP) and be solved by reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. Unlike traditional recommendation methods, including collaborative filtering and content-based filtering, RL is able to handle the sequential, dynamic user-system interaction and to take into account the long-term user engagement. Although the idea of using RL for recommendation is not new and has been around for about two decades, it was not very practical, mainly because of scalability problems of traditional RL algorithms. However, a new trend has emerged in the field since the introduction of deep reinforcement learning (DRL), which made it possible to apply RL to the recommendation problem with large state and action spaces. In this paper, a survey on reinforcement learning based recommender systems (RLRSs) is presented. Our aim is to present an outlook on the field and to provide the reader with a fairly complete knowledge of key concepts of the field. We first recognize and illustrate that RLRSs can be generally classified into RL- and DRL-based methods. Then, we propose an RLRS framework with four components, i.e., state representation, policy optimization, reward formulation, and environment building, and survey RLRS algorithms accordingly. We highlight emerging topics and depict important trends using various graphs and tables. Finally, we discuss important aspects and challenges that can be addressed in the future.",6

","PURPOSE To increase awareness, outline strategies, and offer guidance on the recommended management of immune-related adverse events (irAEs) in patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICPi) therapy. METHODS A multidisciplinary panel of medical oncology, dermatology, gastroenterology, rheumatology, pulmonology, endocrinology, neurology, hematology, emergency medicine, nursing, trialists, and advocacy experts was convened to update the guideline. Guideline development involved a systematic literature review and an informal consensus process. The systematic review focused on evidence published from 2017 through 2021. RESULTS A total of 175 studies met the eligibility criteria of the systematic review and were pertinent to the development of the recommendations. Because of the paucity of high-quality evidence, recommendations are based on expert consensus. RECOMMENDATIONS Recommendations for specific organ system–based toxicity diagnosis and management are presented. While management varies according to the organ system affected, in general, ICPi therapy should be continued with close monitoring for grade 1 toxicities, except for some neurologic, hematologic, and cardiac toxicities. ICPi therapy may be suspended for most grade 2 toxicities, with consideration of resuming when symptoms revert ≤ grade 1. Corticosteroids may be administered. Grade 3 toxicities generally warrant suspension of ICPis and the initiation of high-dose corticosteroids. Corticosteroids should be tapered over the course of at least 4-6 weeks. Some refractory cases may require other immunosuppressive therapy. In general, permanent discontinuation of ICPis is recommended with grade 4 toxicities, except for endocrinopathies that have been controlled by hormone replacement.

","While recent years have witnessed a rapid growth of research papers on recommender system (RS), most of the papers focus on inventing machine learning models to better fit user behavior data. However, user behavior data is observational rather than experimental. This makes various biases widely exist in the data, including but not limited to selection bias, position bias, exposure bias, and popularity bias. Blindly fitting the data without considering the inherent biases will result in many serious issues, e.g., the discrepancy between offline evaluation and online metrics, hurting user satisfaction and trust on the recommendation service, etc. To transform the large volume of research models into practical improvements, it is highly urgent to explore the impacts of the biases and perform debiasing when necessary. When reviewing the papers that consider biases in RS, we find that, to our surprise, the studies are rather fragmented and lack a systematic organization. The terminology “bias” is widely used in the literature, but its definition is usually vague and even inconsistent across papers. This motivates us to provide a systematic survey of existing work on RS biases. In this paper, we first summarize seven types of biases in recommendation, along with their definitions and characteristics. We then provide a taxonomy to position and organize the existing work on recommendation debiasing. Finally, we identify some open challenges and envision some future directions, with the hope of inspiring more research work on this important yet less investigated topic. The summary of debiasing methods reviewed in this survey can be found at https://github.com/jiawei-chen/RecDebiasing.",15

","Industrial recommender systems deal with extremely large action spaces -- many millions of items to recommend. Moreover, they need to serve billions of users, who are unique at any point in time, making a complex user state space. Luckily, huge quantities of logged implicit feedback (e.g., user clicks, dwell time) are available for learning. Learning from the logged feedback is however subject to biases caused by only observing feedback on recommendations selected by the previous versions of the recommender. In this work, we present a general recipe of addressing such biases in a production top-K recommender system at Youtube, built with a policy-gradient-based algorithm, i.e. REINFORCE. The contributions of the paper are: (1) scaling REINFORCE to a production recommender system with an action space on the orders of millions; (2) applying off-policy correction to address data biases in learning from logged feedback collected from multiple behavior policies; (3) proposing a novel top-K off-policy correction to account for our policy recommending multiple items at a time; (4) showcasing the value of exploration. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approaches through a series of simulations and multiple live experiments on Youtube.",17

","Nutrient-based meal recommendations have the potential to help individuals prevent or manage conditions such as diabetes and obesity. However, learning people’s food preferences and making recommendations that simultaneously appeal to their palate and satisfy nutritional expectations are challenging. Existing approaches either only learn high-level preferences or require a prolonged learning period. We propose Yum-me, a personalized nutrient-based meal recommender system designed to meet individuals’ nutritional expectations, dietary restrictions, and fine-grained food preferences. Yum-me enables a simple and accurate food preference profiling procedure via a visual quiz-based user interface and projects the learned profile into the domain of nutritionally appropriate food options to find ones that will appeal to the user. We present the design and implementation of Yum-me and further describe and evaluate two innovative contributions. The first contriution is an open source state-of-the-art food image analysis model, named FoodDist. We demonstrate FoodDist’s superior performance through careful benchmarking and discuss its applicability across a wide array of dietary applications. The second contribution is a novel online learning framework that learns food preference from itemwise and pairwise image comparisons. We evaluate the framework in a field study of 227 anonymous users and demonstrate that it outperforms other baselines by a significant margin. We further conducted an end-to-end validation of the feasibility and effectiveness of Yum-me through a 60-person user study, in which Yum-me improves the recommendation acceptance rate by 42.63%.",7

","The benefits of a state-based, national reporting system to track the incidence and characteristics of a health condition have been well established in other areas such as infectious diseases and motor vehicle safety.

The database has facilitated the development and evaluation of science-based policies aimed at creating safer cars, safer drivers and safer roads. The Institute of Medicine’s report, Reducing the Burden of Injury, has recommended a national data system for homicides and suicides that would provide objective data to monitor trends and to evaluate the effectiveness of prevention programs and policies. Additionally, the Healthy People 2010 report calls for a reduction in homicide and suicide rates over the next decade. The U.S. Surgeon General’s Call to Action to Prevent Suicide further recognized that more people die from suicide than homicide in the United States and has called for a “national violent death reporting system that includes suicide,” and, most recently, a Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) publication called for the establishment of a National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS).",26

","Generalized linear models with nonlinear feature transformations are widely used for large-scale regression and classification problems with sparse inputs. Memorization of feature interactions through a wide set of cross-product feature transformations are effective and interpretable, while generalization requires more feature engineering effort. With less feature engineering, deep neural networks can generalize better to unseen feature combinations through low-dimensional dense embeddings learned for the sparse features. However, deep neural networks with embeddings can over-generalize and recommend less relevant items when the user-item interactions are sparse and high-rank. In this paper, we present Wide & Deep learning---jointly trained wide linear models and deep neural networks---to combine the benefits of memorization and generalization for recommender systems. We productionized and evaluated the system on Google Play, a commercial mobile app store with over one billion active users and over one million apps. Online experiment results show that Wide & Deep significantly increased app acquisitions compared with wide-only and deep-only models. We have also open-sourced our implementation in TensorFlow.",32

","A standard model for Recommender Systems is the Matrix Completion setting: given partially known matrix of ratings given by users (rows) to items (columns), infer the unknown ratings. In the last decades, few attempts where done to handle that objective with Neural Networks, but recently an architecture based on Autoencoders proved to be a promising approach. In current paper, we enhanced that architecture (i) by using a loss function adapted to input data with missing values, and (ii) by incorporating side information. The experiments demonstrate that while side information only slightly improve the test error averaged on all users/items, it has more impact on cold users/items.",10

","Recommender systems, which provide users with recommendations of content suited to their needs, have received great attention in today’s online business world. However, most recommendation approaches exploit only a single source of input data and suffer from the data sparsity problem and the cold start problem. To improve recommendation accuracy in this situation, additional sources of information, such as friend relationship and user-generated tags, should be incorporated in recommendation systems. In this paper, we revise the user-based collaborative filtering (CF) technique, and propose two recommendation approaches fusing usergenerated tags and social relations in a novel way. In order to evaluate the performance of our approaches, we compare experimental results with two baseline methods: user-based CF and user-based CF with weighted friendship similarity using the real datasets (Last.fm and Movielens). Our experimental results show that our methods get higher accuracy. We also verify our methods in cold-start settings, and our methods achieve more precise recommendations than the compared approaches. key words: recommender system, collaborative filtering, social tagging, social network",31

","Recommender systems research is often based on comparisons of predictive accuracy: the better the evaluation scores, the better the recommender. However, it is difficult to compare results from different recommender systems due to the many options in design and implementation of an evaluation strategy. Additionally, algorithmic implementations can diverge from the standard formulation due to manual tuning and modifications that work better in some situations.
 In this work we compare common recommendation algorithms as implemented in three popular recommendation frameworks. To provide a fair comparison, we have complete control of the evaluation dimensions being benchmarked: dataset, data splitting, evaluation strategies, and metrics. We also include results using the internal evaluation mechanisms of these frameworks. Our analysis points to large differences in recommendation accuracy across frameworks and strategies, i.e. the same baselines may perform orders of magnitude better or worse across frameworks. Our results show the necessity of clear guidelines when reporting evaluation of recommender systems to ensure reproducibility and comparison of results.",11

","Newly emerging location-based and event-based social network services provide us with a new platform to understand users' preferences based on their activity history. A user can only visit a limited number of venues/events and most of them are within a limited distance range, so the user-item matrix is very sparse, which creates a big challenge to the traditional collaborative filtering-based recommender systems. The problem becomes even more challenging when people travel to a new city where they have no activity information. In this article, we propose LCARS, a location-content-aware recommender system that offers a particular user a set of venues (e.g., restaurants and shopping malls) or events (e.g., concerts and exhibitions) by giving consideration to both personal interest and local preference. This recommender system can facilitate people's travel not only near the area in which they live, but also in a city that is new to them. Specifically, LCARS consists of two components: offline modeling and online recommendation. The offline modeling part, called LCA-LDA, is designed to learn the interest of each individual user and the local preference of each individual city by capturing item cooccurrence patterns and exploiting item contents. The online recommendation part takes a querying user along with a querying city as input, and automatically combines the learned interest of the querying user and the local preference of the querying city to produce the top-k recommendations. To speed up the online process, a scalable query processing technique is developed by extending both the Threshold Algorithm (TA) and TA-approximation algorithm. We evaluate the performance of our recommender system on two real datasets, that is, DoubanEvent and Foursquare, and one large-scale synthetic dataset. The results show the superiority of LCARS in recommending spatial items for users, especially when traveling to new cities, in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency. Besides, the experimental analysis results also demonstrate the excellent interpretability of LCARS.",7

","This paper proposes LARS*, a location-aware recommender system that uses location-based ratings to produce recommendations. Traditional recommender systems do not consider spatial properties of users nor items; LARS*, on the other hand, supports a taxonomy of three novel classes of location-based ratings, namely, spatial ratings for non-spatial items, non-spatial ratings for spatial items, and spatial ratings for spatial items. LARS* exploits user rating locations through user partitioning, a technique that influences recommendations with ratings spatially close to querying users in a manner that maximizes system scalability while not sacrificing recommendation quality. LARS* exploits item locations using travel penalty, a technique that favors recommendation candidates closer in travel distance to querying users in a way that avoids exhaustive access to all spatial items. LARS* can apply these techniques separately, or together, depending on the type of location-based rating available. Experimental evidence using large-scale real-world data from both the Foursquare location-based social network and the MovieLens movie recommendation system reveals that LARS* is efficient, scalable, and capable of producing recommendations twice as accurate compared to existing recommendation approaches.",40

","Context-aware recommender system (CARS) is a highly researched and implemented way of providing a personalized service that helps users to find their desired content. One of the remaining issues is how to decide which contextual information to acquire and how to incorporate it into CARS. While the relevant contextual information will improve the recommendations, the irrelevant contextual information could have a negative impact on the recommendation accuracy. By testing the independence between the contextual variable on the users’ ratings for items, we can detect its relevanceandimpactonthefeedbackfortheitemconsumedinthatspecificcontext.Inthisarticle,we propose several new theoretical concepts that should help deciding which information to use, as well as a methodology for detecting which contextual information contributes to explaining the variance in the ratings, based on statistical testing. The experiment was conducted on the real movie dataset that contains 12 different pieces of contextual information. We used two statistical tests with power analysis for the detection, and three contextualized matrix-factorization algorithms with slightly different reasoning for the prediction of ratings. The results showed a significant difference in the prediction of ratings in the context that was detected as relevant by our method, and the one that was detected as irrelevant, pointing to the importance of the power analysis and the benefits of the proposed method in the case of a small dataset.",25

","This paper presents a recommender system for both taxi drivers and people expecting to take a taxi, using the knowledge of 1) passengers' mobility patterns and 2) taxi drivers' picking-up/dropping-off behaviors learned from the GPS trajectories of taxicabs. First, this recommender system provides taxi drivers with some locations and the routes to these locations, toward which they are more likely to pick up passengers quickly (during the routes or in these locations) and maximize the profit of the next trip. Second, it recommends people with some locations (within a walking distance) where they can easily find vacant taxis. In our method, we learn the above-mentioned knowledge (represented by probabilities) from GPS trajectories of taxis. Then, we feed the knowledge into a probabilistic model that estimates the profit of the candidate locations for a particular driver based on where and when the driver requests the recommendation. We build our system using historical trajectories generated by over 12,000 taxis during 110 days and validate the system with extensive evaluations including in-the-field user studies.",7

","Recommender systems are an important part of the information and e-commerce ecosystem. They represent a powerful method for enabling users to filter through large information and product spaces. Nearly two decades of research on collaborative filtering have led to a varied set of algorithms and a rich collection of tools for evaluating their performance. Research in the field is moving in the direction of a richer understanding of how recommender technology may be embedded in specific domains. The differing personalities exhibited by different recommender algorithms show that recommendation is not a one-size-fits-all problem. Specific tasks, information needs, and item domains represent unique problems for recommenders, and design and evaluation of recommenders needs to be done based on the user tasks to be supported. Effective deployments must begin with careful analysis of prospective users and their goals. Based on this analysis, system designers have a host of options for the choice of algorithm and for its embedding in the surrounding user experience. This paper discusses a~wide variety of the choices available and their implications, aiming to provide both practicioners and researchers with an introduction to the important issues underlying recommenders and current best practices for addressing these issues.",13

","Background: People from different cultural backgrounds have used different forms of Traditional Medicine as a means to managing their ailments. This study examined public perceptions of the role of Traditional Medicine in relation to the accessibility, conditions treated, safety, efficacy rate and interactions between traditional and orthodox medical systems in the Sekyere South District of Ashanti, Ghana. Methods: This was a descriptive cross-sectional survey. A sample of 70 Traditional Medical Practitioners, 30 health care users, and 20 Orthodox Medical Practitioners were used and selected respectively based on snowball, random sampling and purposive techniques. Both quantitative and qualitative data were collected through administered-questionnaire and in-depth interviews. Non-participant observation was used to assess the working environments of the practitioners in 9 selected communities in the district. Relevant data obtained were analysed using both qualitative and quantitative methods. Percentages and cross-tabulations, using the Predictive Analytic Software (PASW), version i6.0 were the methods used to analyse the data. Findings: The main findings suggest that Traditional Medicine is effective as it was employed in treating numerous medical conditions such as malaria, typhoid fever, arthritis, jaundice, impotency, infertility, stroke, broken bones, boils, piles, HIV/AIDS, mental illness, etc. However, safety of use of the Traditional Medicine is not standardized. Moreover, there is some form of interaction between the two health care providers through cross-referrals though; the cross-referral systems are not coordinated and strictly unofficial. Traditional Medicine is readily available to the people and also less expensive, hence easily accessible. Policy options that seek to address some difficulties and challenges encountered by the practices of Traditional Medicine and improving upon the quality, safety, and standard of service are recommended. Conclusion: The conclusion drawn from the research is that Traditional Medicine is used by many people to managing numerous conditions. It is accessible and effective. It therefore plays a significant role by reducing life-threatening ailments of humanity. This study adds to the scant but growing documented literature about the potentials of Traditional Medicine.",14

","Recommender systems use people's opinions about items in an information domain to help people choose other items. These systems have succeeded in domains as diverse as movies, news articles, Web pages, and wines. The psychological literature on conformity suggests that in the course of helping people make choices, these systems probably affect users' opinions of the items. If opinions are influenced by recommendations, they might be less valuable for making recommendations for other users. Further, manipulators who seek to make the system generate artificially high or low recommendations might benefit if their efforts influence users to change the opinions they contribute to the recommender. We study two aspects of recommender system interfaces that may affect users' opinions: the rating scale and the display of predictions at the time users rate items. We find that users rate fairly consistently across rating scales. Users can be manipulated, though, tending to rate toward the prediction the system shows, whether the prediction is accurate or not. However, users can detect systems that manipulate predictions. We discuss how designers of recommender systems might react to these findings.",7

","Recommender systems assist and augment this natural social process. In a typical recommender system people provide recommendations as inputs, which the system then aggregates and directs to appropriate recipients. In some cases the primary transformation is in the aggregation; in others the system’s value lies in its ability to make good matches between the recommenders and those seeking recommendations. The developers of the first recommender system, Tapestry [1], coined the phrase “collaborative filtering” and several others have adopted it. We prefer the more general term “recommender system” for two reasons. First, recommenders may not explictly collaborate with recipients, who may be unknown to each other. Second, recommendations may suggest particularly interesting items, in addition to indicating those that should be filtered out. This special section includes descriptions of five recommender systems. A sixth article analyzes incentives for provision of recommendations. Figure 1 places the systems in a technical design space defined by five dimensions. First, the contents of an evaluation can be anything from a single bit (recommended or not) to unstructured textual annotations. Second, recommendations may be entered explicitly, but several systems gather implicit evaluations: GroupLens monitors users’ reading times; PHOAKS mines Usenet articles for mentions of URLs; and Siteseer mines personal bookmark lists. Third, recommendations may be anonymous, tagged with the source’s identity, or tagged with a pseudonym. The fourth dimension, and one of the richest areas for exploration, is how to aggregate evaluations. GroupLens, PHOAKS, and Siteseer employ variants on weighted voting. Fab takes that one step further to combine evaluations with content analysis. ReferralWeb combines suggested links between people to form longer referral chains. Finally, the (perhaps aggregated) evaluations may be used in several ways: negative recommendations may be filtered out, the items may be sorted according to numeric evaluations, or evaluations may accompany items in a display. Figures 2 and 3 identify dimensions of the domain space: The kinds of items being recommended and the people among whom evaluations are shared. Consider, first, the domain of items. The sheer volume is an important variable: Detailed textual reviews of restaurants or movies may be practical, but applying the same approach to thousands of daily Netnews messages would not. Ephemeral media such as netnews (most news servers throw away articles after one or two weeks) place a premium on gathering and distributing evaluations quickly, while evaluations for 19th century books can be gathered at a more leisurely pace. The last dimension describes the cost structure of choices people make about the items. Is it very costly to miss IT IS OFTEN NECESSARY TO MAKE CHOICES WITHOUT SUFFICIENT personal experience of the alternatives. In everyday life, we rely on",19

","The Social Transformation of American Medicine is one of the most comprehensive studies on the rise of the medical profession and the development of the health care industry published to date, Starr is able to span the fields of medicine so that he discusses intelligently the economic, political, and historical developments in medical care. His wri ting is clear and succinct, his arguments are copiously footnoted, and the inferences he draws are sound. In Book I, he covers ""the rise of medical authority and the shaping of the medical system""; in Book II, ""doctors, the State, and the coming of the corporation."" Reviews by Daniel Bell of Harvard and George Silver of Yale call Starr's work brilliant-I would agree. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to understand the current health care system. Starr describes the movement of the medical profession from one that was initially viewed skeptically to one that was later embraced; and now, coming full circle, to one that is viewed critically. Starr maintains that the current status of American medicine is the result of our history of accommodating professional interests while failing to exercise control over health programs, and then needing to adopt piecemeal regulations and cut-backs on programs that become too inflationary, One of the primary messages I take from this book is the importance of a com bination of forces: a profession's authority, the political climate, and the current philosophy about health care. Starr illustrates how these forces coalesce to defeat or achieve medical improvements. As occupational therapists, we are dependent on the development of the health care industry. It is wise for us to understand the forces that have an impact on medical care and what they could mean for our profession, Kay Barbara Schwartz, M.S., OTR",31

","Recent advancements in deep neural networks for graph-structured data have led to state-of-the-art performance on recommender system benchmarks. However, making these methods practical and scalable to web-scale recommendation tasks with billions of items and hundreds of millions of users remains an unsolved challenge. Here we describe a large-scale deep recommendation engine that we developed and deployed at Pinterest. We develop a data-efficient Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) algorithm, which combines efficient random walks and graph convolutions to generate embeddings of nodes (i.e., items) that incorporate both graph structure as well as node feature information. Compared to prior GCN approaches, we develop a novel method based on highly efficient random walks to structure the convolutions and design a novel training strategy that relies on harder-and-harder training examples to improve robustness and convergence of the model. We also develop an efficient MapReduce model inference algorithm to generate embeddings using a trained model. Overall, we can train on and embed graphs that are four orders of magnitude larger than typical GCN implementations. We show how GCN embeddings can be used to make high-quality recommendations in various settings at Pinterest, which has a massive underlying graph with 3 billion nodes representing pins and boards, and 17 billion edges. According to offline metrics, user studies, as well as A/B tests, our approach generates higher-quality recommendations than comparable deep learning based systems. To our knowledge, this is by far the largest application of deep graph embeddings to date and paves the way for a new generation of web-scale recommender systems based on graph convolutional architectures.",43

","We propose a novel way to train ranking models, such as recommender systems, that are both effective and efficient. Knowledge distillation (KD) was shown to be successful in image recognition to achieve both effectiveness and efficiency. We propose a KD technique for learning to rank problems, called ranking distillation (RD). Specifically, we train a smaller student model to learn to rank documents/items from both the training data and the supervision of a larger teacher model. The student model achieves a similar ranking performance to that of the large teacher model, but its smaller model size makes the online inference more efficient. RD is flexible because it is orthogonal to the choices of ranking models for the teacher and student. We address the challenges of RD for ranking problems. The experiments on public data sets and state-of-the-art recommendation models showed that RD achieves its design purposes: the student model learnt with RD has less than an half size of the teacher model while achieving a ranking performance similar tothe teacher model and much better than the student model learnt without RD.",30

","With a large amount of user activity data accumulated, it is crucial to exploit user sequential behavior for sequential recommendations. Conventionally, user general taste and recent demand are combined to promote recommendation performances. However, existing methods often neglect that user long-term preference keep evolving over time, and building a static representation for user general taste may not adequately reflect the dynamic characters. Moreover, they integrate user-item or item-item interactions through a linear way which limits the capability of model. To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel two-layer hierarchical attention network, which takes the above properties into account, to recommend the next item user might be interested. Specifically, the first attention layer learns user long-term preferences based on the historical purchased item representation, while the second one outputs final user representation through coupling user long-term and short-term preferences.

","A personalized conversational sales agent could have much commercial potential. E-commerce companies such as Amazon, eBay, JD, Alibaba etc. are piloting such kind of agents with their users. However, the research on this topic is very limited and existing solutions are either based on single round adhoc search engine or traditional multi round dialog system. They usually only utilize user inputs in the current session, ignoring users' long term preferences. On the other hand, it is well known that sales conversion rate can be greatly improved based on recommender systems, which learn user preferences based on past purchasing behavior and optimize business oriented metrics such as conversion rate or expected revenue. In this work, we propose to integrate research in dialog systems and recommender systems into a novel and unified deep reinforcement learning framework to build a personalized conversational recommendation agent that optimizes a per session based utility function. In particular, we propose to represent a user conversation history as a semi-structured user query with facet-value pairs. This query is generated and updated by belief tracker that analyzes natural language utterances of user at each step. We propose a set of machine actions tailored for recommendation agents and train a deep policy network to decide which action (i.e. asking for the value of a facet or making a recommendation) the agent should take at each step. We train a personalized recommendation model that uses both the user's past ratings and user query collected in the current conversational session when making rating predictions and generating recommendations. Such a conversational system often tries to collect user preferences by asking questions. Once enough user preference is collected, it makes personalized recommendations to the user. We perform both simulation experiments and real online user studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.",41

","Related Pins is the Web-scale recommender system that powers over 40% of user engagement on Pinterest. This paper is a longitudinal study of three years of its development, exploring the evolution of the system and its components from prototypes to present state. Each component was originally built with many constraints on engineering effort and computational resources, so we prioritized the simplest and highest-leverage solutions. We show how organic growth led to a complex system and how we managed this complexity. Many challenges arose while building this system, such as avoiding feedback loops, evaluating performance, activating content, and eliminating legacy heuristics. Finally, we offer suggestions for tackling these challenges when engineering Web-scale recommender systems.",7

","The GPS technology and new forms of urban geography have changed the paradigm for mobile services. As such, the abundant availability of GPS traces has enabled new ways of doing taxi business. Indeed, recent efforts have been made on developing mobile recommender systems for taxi drivers using Taxi GPS traces. These systems can recommend a sequence of pick-up points for the purpose of maximizing the probability of identifying a customer with the shortest driving distance. However, in the real world, the income of taxi drivers is strongly correlated with the effective driving hours. In other words, it is more critical for taxi drivers to know the actual driving routes to minimize the driving time before finding a customer. To this end, in this paper, we propose to develop a cost-effective recommender system for taxi drivers. The design goal is to maximize their profits when following the recommended routes for finding passengers. Specifically, we first design a net profit objective function for evaluating the potential profits of the driving routes. Then, we develop a graph representation of road networks by mining the historical taxi GPS traces and provide a Brute-Force strategy to generate optimal driving route for recommendation. However, a critical challenge along this line is the high computational cost of the graph based approach. Therefore, we develop a novel recursion strategy based on the special form of the net profit function for searching optimal candidate routes efficiently. Particularly, instead of recommending a sequence of pick-up points and letting the driver decide how to get to those points, our recommender system is capable of providing an entire driving route, and the drivers are able to find a customer for the largest potential profit by following the recommendations. This makes our recommender system more practical and profitable than other existing recommender systems. Finally, we carry out extensive experiments on a real-world data set collected from the San Francisco Bay area and the experimental results clearly validate the effectiveness of the proposed recommender system.",25

","Newly emerging location-based and event-based social network services provide us with a new platform to understand users' preferences based on their activity history. A user can only visit a limited number of venues/events and most of them are within a limited distance range, so the user-item matrix is very sparse, which creates a big challenge for traditional collaborative filtering-based recommender systems. The problem becomes more challenging when people travel to a new city where they have no activity history. In this paper, we propose LCARS, a location-content-aware recommender system that offers a particular user a set of venues (e.g., restaurants) or events (e.g., concerts and exhibitions) by giving consideration to both personal interest and local preference. This recommender system can facilitate people's travel not only near the area in which they live, but also in a city that is new to them. Specifically, LCARS consists of two components: offline modeling and online recommendation. The offline modeling part, called LCA-LDA, is designed to learn the interest of each individual user and the local preference of each individual city by capturing item co-occurrence patterns and exploiting item contents. The online recommendation part automatically combines the learnt interest of the querying user and the local preference of the querying city to produce the top-k recommendations. To speed up this online process, a scalable query processing technique is developed by extending the classic Threshold Algorithm (TA). We evaluate the performance of our recommender system on two large-scale real data sets, DoubanEvent and Foursquare. The results show the superiority of LCARS in recommending spatial items for users, especially when traveling to new cities, in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency.",8

","Contexts and social network information have been proven to be valuable information for building accurate recommender system. However, to the best of our knowledge, no existing works systematically combine diverse types of such information to further improve recommendation quality. In this paper, we propose SoCo, a novel context-aware recommender system incorporating elaborately processed social network information. We handle contextual information by applying random decision trees to partition the original user-item-rating matrix such that the ratings with similar contexts are grouped. Matrix factorization is then employed to predict missing preference of a user for an item using the partitioned matrix. In order to incorporate social network information, we introduce an additional social regularization term to the matrix factorization objective function to infer a user's preference for an item by learning opinions from his/her friends who are expected to share similar tastes. A context-aware version of Pearson Correlation Coefficient is proposed to measure user similarity. Real datasets based experiments show that SoCo improves the performance (in terms of root mean square error) of the state-of-the-art context-aware recommender system and social recommendation model by 15.7% and 12.2% respectively.",8

","Recommendation accuracy is a fundamental problem in the quality of the recommendation system. In this article, we propose an efficient deep matrix factorization (EDMF) with review feature learning for the industrial recommender system. Two characteristics in user’s review are revealed. First, interactivity between the user and the item, which can also be considered as the former’s scoring behavior on the latter, is exploited in a review. Second, the review is only a partial description of the user’s preferences for the item, which is revealed as the sparsity property. Specifically, in the first characteristic, EDMF extracts the interactive features of onefold review by convolutional neural networks with word-attention mechanism. Subsequently, ${L}_{0}$ norm is leveraged to constrain the review considering that the review information is a sparse feature, which is the second characteristic. Furthermore, the loss function is constructed by maximum a posteriori estimation theory, where the interactivity and sparsity property are converted as two prior probability functions. Finally, the alternative minimization algorithm is introduced to optimize the loss functions. Experimental results on several datasets demonstrate that the proposed methods, which show good industrial conversion application prospects, outperform the state-of-the-art methods in terms of effectiveness and efficiency.",4

In this tutorial, we focus on the critical challenges of GNN-based recommendation and the potential solutions. Specifically, we start from an extensive background of recommender systems and graph neural networks. Then we fully discuss why GNNs are required in recommender systems and the four parts of challenges, including graph construction, network design, optimization, and computation efficiency. Then, we discuss how to address these challenges by elaborating on the recent advances of GNN-based recommendation models, with a systematic taxonomy from four critical perspectives: stages, scenarios, objectives, and applications.

","The aim of this paper is to present the use of an innovative approach based on MCDM methods as the main component of a consumer Decision Support System (DSS) by recommending the most suitable products among a given set of alternatives. This system provides a reliable recommendation to the consumer in the form of a compromise ranking constructed from the five MCDM methods: the hybrid approach TOPSIS-COMET, COCOSO, EDAS, MAIRCA, and MABAC. Each of the methods used contributes significantly to the final compromise ranking built with the Copeland strategy. Chosen MCDM methods were combined with the objective CRITIC weighting method, and their performance was presented on the illustrative example of choosing the most suitable mobile phone. A sensitivity analysis involving the rw and WS correlation coefficients was performed to determine the match between the compromise ranking of the candidates and the rankings provided by each MCDM method. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated that all investigated compromise candidate rankings show high convergence with the rankings provided by the particular MCDM methods. Thus, the performed study proved that the proposed approach shows high potential to be successfully used as a central component of DSS for recommending the most suitable product. Such DSS could be a universal and future-proof solution for e-commerce sites and websites, providing advanced product comparison capabilities in delivering a recommendation to the user as a final ranking of alternatives.",7

","With the development of the Internet, technology, and means of communication, the production of tourist data has multiplied at all levels (hotels, restaurants, transport, heritage, tourist events, activities, etc.), especially with the development of Online Travel Agency (OTA). However, the list of possibilities offered to tourists by these Web search engines (or even specialized tourist sites) can be overwhelming and relevant results are usually drowned in informational ""noise"", which prevents, or at least slows down the selection process. To assist tourists in trip planning and help them to find the information they are looking for, many recommender systems have been developed. In this article, we present an overview of the various recommendation approaches used in the field of tourism. From this study, an architecture and a conceptual framework for tourism recommender system are proposed, based on a hybrid recommendation approach. The proposed system goes beyond the recommendation of a list of tourist attractions, tailored to tourist preferences. It can be seen as a trip planner that designs a detailed program, including heterogeneous tourism resources, for a specific visit duration. The ultimate goal is to develop a recommender system based on big data technologies, artificial intelligence, and operational research to promote tourism in Morocco, specifically in the Daraa-Tafilalet region.",29

","Imagine a food recommender system—how would we check if it is causing and fostering unhealthy eating habits or merely reflecting users’ interests? How much of a user’s experience over time with a recommender is caused by the recommender system’s choices and biases, and how much is based on the user’s preferences and biases? Popularity bias and filter bubbles are two of the most well-studied recommender system biases, but most of the prior research has focused on understanding the system behavior in a single recommendation step. How do these biases interplay with user behavior, and what types of user experiences are created from repeated interactions? In this work, we offer a simulation framework for measuring the impact of a recommender system under different types of user behavior. Using this simulation framework, we can (a) isolate the effect of the recommender system from the user preferences, and (b) examine how the system performs not just on average for an “average user” but also the extreme experiences under atypical user behavior. As part of the simulation framework, we propose a set of evaluation metrics over the simulations to understand the recommender system’s behavior. Finally, we present two empirical case studies—one on traditional collaborative filtering in MovieLens and one on a large-scale production recommender system—to understand how popularity bias manifests over time.

","INTRODUCTION
This guideline establishes clinical practice recommendations for the treatment of central disorders of hypersomnolence in adults and children.


METHODS
The American Academy of Sleep Medicine commissioned a task force of experts in sleep medicine to develop recommendations and assign strengths to each recommendation, based on a systematic review of the literature and an assessment of the evidence using the GRADE process. The task force provided a summary of the relevant literature and the quality of evidence, the balance of benefits and harms, patient values and preferences, and resource use considerations that support the recommendations. The AASM Board of Directors approved the final recommendations.


RECOMMENDATIONS
The following recommendations are intended to guide clinicians in choosing a specific treatment for central disorders of hypersomnolence in adults and children. Each recommendation statement is assigned a strength (""strong"" or ""conditional""). A ""strong"" recommendation (ie, ""We recommend…"") is one that clinicians should follow under most circumstances. A ""conditional"" recommendation (ie, ""We suggest…"") is one that requires that the clinician use clinical knowledge and experience and strongly consider the individual patient's values and preferences to determine the best course of action. Under each disorder, strong recommendations are listed in alphabetical order followed by the conditional recommendations in alphabetical order. The section on adult patients with hypersomnia because of medical conditions is categorized based on the clinical and pathological subtypes identified in ICSD-3. The interventions in all the recommendation statements were compared to no treatment.

","Recommender system is one of the most important information services on today’s Internet. Recently, graph neural networks have become the new state-of-the-art approach to recommender systems. In this survey, we conduct a comprehensive review of the literature on graph neural network-based recommender systems. We first introduce the background and the history of the development of both recommender systems and graph neural networks. For recommender systems, in general, there are four aspects for categorizing existing works: stage, scenario, objective, and application. For graph neural networks, the existing methods consist of two categories: spectral models and spatial ones. We then discuss the motivation of applying graph neural networks into recommender systems, mainly consisting of the high-order connectivity, the structural property of data and the enhanced supervision signal. We then systematically analyze the challenges in graph construction, embedding propagation/aggregation, model optimization, and computation efficiency. Afterward and primarily, we provide a comprehensive overview of a multitude of existing works of graph neural network-based recommender systems, following the taxonomy above. Finally, we raise discussions on the open problems and promising future directions in this area. We summarize the representative papers along with their code repositories in https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/GNN-Recommender-Systems.",43

","Nowadays, recommender systems have become essential to users for finding “what they need” within large collections of items. Meanwhile, recent studies have demonstrated as user personality can effectively provide a more valuable information to significantly improve recommenders’ performance, especially considering behavioral data captured from social network logs. In this work, we describe a novel music recommendation technique based on the identification of personality traits, moods, and emotions of a single user, starting from solid psychological observations recognized by the analysis of user behavior within a social environment. In particular, users’ personality and mood have been embedded within a content-based filtering approach to obtain more accurate and dynamic results. Several experiments are then reported to show effectiveness of user personality and mood recognition recommendation, thus, encouraging research in this direction.",7

","Recommender systems, which analyze users’ preference patterns to suggest potential targets, are indispensable in today’s society. Collaborative Filtering (CF) is the most popular recommendation model. Specifically, Graph Neural Network (GNN) has become a new state-of-the-art for CF. In the GNN-based recommender system, message dropout is usually used to alleviate the selection bias in the user-item bipartite graph. However, message dropout might deteriorate the recommender system’s performance due to the randomness of dropping out the outgoing messages based on the user-item bipartite graph. To solve this problem, we propose a graph contrastive learning module for a general recommender system that learns the embeddings in a self-supervised manner and reduces the randomness of message dropout. Besides, many recommender systems optimize models with pairwise ranking objectives, such as the Bayesian Pairwise Ranking (BPR) based on a negative sampling strategy. However, BPR has the following problems: suboptimal sampling and sample bias. We introduce a new debiased contrastive loss to solve these problems, which provides sufficient negative samples and applies a bias correction probability to alleviate the sample bias. We integrate the proposed framework, including graph contrastive module and debiased contrastive module with several Matrix Factorization(MF) and GNN-based recommendation models. Experimental results on three public benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.",32

 MOBA games are currently one the most popular online game genres. In their basic gameplay, two teams of multiple players compete against each other to destroy the enemy's base, controlling a powerful unit known as ""hero"". Each hero has different abilities, roles and strengths. Thus, choosing a good combination of heroes is fundamental for the success in the game. In this paper we propose a recommendation system for selecting heroes in a MOBA game. We develop a mechanism based on association rules that suggests the more suitable heroes for composing a team, using data collected from a large number of DOTA 2 matches. For evaluating the efficacy of the line-up, we trained a neural network capable of predicting the winner team with a 88.63% accuracy. The results of the recommendation system were very satisfactory with up to 74.9% success rate.

Over a four-week user study, four different types of energy-saving recommendations were trained and learned. recEnergy improves building energy reduction from a baseline saving (passive-only strategy) of 19%–26%.",18

In this short paper, we present a recommendation strategy based on knowledge about food and users' health-related characteristics to generate personalized recipes suggestions. By focusing on personal factors as a user's BMI and dietary constraints, we exploited a holistic user model to re-rank a basic recommendation list of 4,671 recipes, and investigated in a web-based experiment (N=200) to what extent it generated satisfactory food recommendations. We found that some of the information encoded in a users' holistic user profiles affected their preferences, thus providing us with interesting findings to continue this line of research.",28

","Animated transitions help viewers follow changes between related visualizations. Specifying effective animations demands significant effort: authors must select the elements and properties to animate, provide transition parameters, and coordinate the timing of stages. To facilitate this process, we present Gemini, a declarative grammar and recommendation system for animated transitions between single-view statistical graphics. Gemini specifications define transition “steps” in terms of high-level visual components (marks, axes, legends) and composition rules to synchronize and concatenate steps. With this grammar, Gemini can recommend animation designs to augment and accelerate designers' work. Gemini enumerates staged animation designs for given start and end states, and ranks those designs using a cost function informed by prior perceptual studies. To evaluate Gemini, we conduct both a formative study on Mechanical Turk to assess and tune our ranking function, and a summative study in which 8 experienced visualization developers implement animations in D3 that we then compare to Gemini's suggestions. We find that most designs (9/11) are exactly replicable in Gemini, with many (8/11) achievable via edits to suggestions, and that Gemini suggestions avoid multiple participant errors.",7

","This research aims to determine the similarities in groups of people to build a film recommender system for users. Users often have difficulty in finding suitable movies due to the increasing amount of movie information. The recommender system is very useful for helping customers choose a preferred movie with the existing features. In this study, the recommender system development is established by using several algorithms to obtain groupings, such as the K-Means algorithm, birch algorithm, mini-batch K-Means algorithm, mean-shift algorithm, affinity propagation algorithm, agglomerative clustering algorithm, and spectral clustering algorithm. We propose methods optimizing K so that each cluster may not significantly increase variance. We are limited to using groupings based on Genre and Tags for movies. This research can discover better methods for evaluating clustering algorithms. To verify the quality of the recommender system, we adopted the mean square error (MSE), such as the Dunn Matrix and Cluster Validity Indices, and social network analysis (SNA), such as Degree Centrality, Closeness Centrality, and Betweenness Centrality. We also used average similarity, computational time, association rule with Apriori algorithm, and clustering performance evaluation as evaluation measures to compare method performance of recommender systems using Silhouette Coefficient, Calinski-Harabaz Index, and Davies–Bouldin Index.",25

In general, recommender systems are data-driven. The more data it uses, the better performance it obtains. The data silo issues is a severe limitation of the recommender’s performance. Federated learning is an emerging technology, which bridges the data silos and builds machine learning models without compromising user privacy and data security. We design a recommender system based on federated learning. It is known as the federated recommender system. The system implements plenty of popular algorithms to support various online recommendation services. The algorithm implementation is open-sourced. We also deploy the system on a real-world content recommendation application, achieving significant performance improvement.

","From the last decade, pharmaceutical companies are facing difficulties in tracking their products during the supply chain process, allowing the counterfeiters to add their fake medicines into the market. Counterfeit drugs are analyzed as a very big challenge for the pharmaceutical industry worldwide. As indicated by the statistics, yearly business loss of around $200 billion is reported by US pharmaceutical companies due to these counterfeit drugs. These drugs may not help the patients to recover the disease but have many other dangerous side effects. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) survey report, in under-developed countries every 10th drug use by the consumers is counterfeit and has low quality. Hence, a system that can trace and track drug delivery at every phase is needed to solve the counterfeiting problem. The blockchain has the full potential to handle and track the supply chain process very efficiently. In this paper, we have proposed and implemented a novel blockchain and machine learning-based drug supply chain management and recommendation system (DSCMR). Our proposed system consists of two main modules: blockchain-based drug supply chain management and machine learning-based drug recommendation system for consumers. In the first module, the drug supply chain management system is deployed using Hyperledger fabrics which is capable of continuously monitor and track the drug delivery process in the smart pharmaceutical industry. On the other hand, the N-gram, LightGBM models are used in the machine learning module to recommend the top-rated or best medicines to the customers of the pharmaceutical industry. These models have trained on well known publicly available drug reviews dataset provided by the UCI: an open-source machine learning repository.

","The feedback data of recommender systems are often subject to what was exposed to the users; however, most learning and evaluation methods do not account for the underlying exposure mechanism. We first show in theory that applying supervised learning to detect user preferences may end up with inconsistent results in the absence of exposure information. The counterfactual propensity-weighting approach from causal inference can account for the exposure mechanism; nevertheless, the partial-observation nature of the feedback data can cause identifiability issues. We propose a principled solution by introducing a minimax empirical risk formulation. We show that the relaxation of the dual problem can be converted to an adversarial game between two recommendation models, where the opponent of the candidate model characterizes the underlying exposure mechanism. We provide learning bounds and conduct extensive simulation studies to illustrate and justify the proposed approach over a broad range of recommendation settings, which shed insights on the various benefits of the proposed approach.",12

","Background Development of a core outcome set (COS) for clinical trials for COVID-19 is urgent because of the pandemic wreaking havoc worldwide and the heterogeneity of outcomes in clinical trials. Methods A preliminary list of outcomes was developed after a systematic review of protocols of clinical trials for COVID-19. Then, two rounds of the Delphi survey were conducted. Stakeholders were traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) experts, Western medicine (WM) experts, nurses, and the public. Patients with confirmed COVID-19 were also invited to participate in a questionnaire written in understandable language. Then different stakeholders participated in a consensus meeting by video conference to vote. Results Ninety-seven eligible study protocols were identified from 160 clinical trials. Seventy-six outcomes were identified from TCM clinical trials and 126 outcomes were identified from WM clinical trials. Finally, 145 outcomes were included in the first round of the Delphi survey. Then, a COS for clinical trials of TCM and WM was developed. The COS included clinical outcomes (recovery/improvement/progression/death), etiology (SARS-CoV-2 nucleic-acid tests, viral load), inflammatory factor (C-reactive protein), vital signs (temperature, respiration), blood and lymphatic-system parameters (lymphocytes, virus antibody), respiratory outcomes (pulmonary imaging, blood oxygen saturation, PaO2/FiO2 ratio, arterial blood gas analysis, mechanical ventilation, oxygen intake, pneumonia severity index), clinical efficacy (prevalence of preventing patients with mild-to-moderate disease progressing to severe disease), and symptoms (clinical symptom score). Outcomes were recommended according to different types of disease. Outcome measurement instruments/definitions were also recommended. Conclusion Though there are some limitations for the research, such as insufficient patients and the public involvement, and the unbalanced stakeholders' region, the COS for COVID-19 may improve consistency of outcome reporting in clinical trials. It also should be updated with research progression.",54

","The first Biograph Vision PET/CT system (Siemens Healthineers) was installed at the University Medical Center Groningen. Improved performance of this system could allow for a reduction in activity administration or scan duration. This study evaluated the effects of reduced scan duration in oncologic 18F-FDG PET imaging on quantitative and subjective imaging parameters and its influence on clinical image interpretation. Methods: Patients referred for a clinical PET/CT scan were enrolled in this study, received a weight-based 18F-FDG injected activity, and underwent list-mode PET acquisition at 180 s per bed position (s/bp). Acquired PET data were reconstructed using the vendor-recommended clinical reconstruction protocol (hereafter referred to as “clinical”), using the clinical protocol with additional 2-mm gaussian filtering (hereafter referred to as “clinical+G2”), and—in conformance with European Association of Nuclear Medicine Research Ltd. (EARL) specifications—using different scan durations per bed position (180, 120, 60, 30, and 10 s). Reconstructed images were quantitatively assessed for comparison of SUVs and noise. In addition, clinically reconstructed images were qualitatively evaluated by 3 nuclear medicine physicians. Results: In total, 30 oncologic patients (22 men, 8 women; age: 48–88 y [range], 67 ± 9.6 y [mean ± SD]) received a single weight-based (3 MBq/kg) 18F-FDG injected activity (weight: 45–123 kg [range], 81 ± 15 kg [mean ± SD]; activity: 135–380 MBq [range], 241 ± 47.3 MBq [mean ± SD]). Significant differences in lesion SUVmax were found between the 180-s/bp images and the 30- and 10-s/bp images reconstructed using the clinical protocols, whereas no differences were found in lesion SUVpeak. EARL-compliant images did not show differences in lesion SUVmax or SUVpeak between scan durations. Quantitative parameters showed minimal deviation (∼5%) in the 60-s/bp images. Therefore, further subjective image quality assessment was conducted using the 60-s/bp images. Qualitative assessment revealed the influence of personal preference on physicians’ willingness to adopt the 60-s/bp images in clinical practice. Although quantitative PET parameters differed minimally, an increase in noise was observed. Conclusion: With the Biograph Vision PET/CT system for oncologic 18F-FDG imaging, scan duration or activity administration could be reduced by a factor of 3 or more with the use of the clinical+G2 or the EARL-compliant reconstruction protocol.",21

","The aim of recommender systems is to automatically identify user preferences within collected data, then use those preferences to make recommendations that help with decisions. However, recommender systems suffer from data sparsity problem, which is particularly prevalent in newly launched systems that have not yet had enough time to amass sufficient data. As a solution, cross-domain recommender systems transfer knowledge from a source domain with relatively rich data to assist recommendations in the target domain. These systems usually assume that the entities either fully overlap or do not overlap at all. In practice, it is more common for the entities in the two domains to partially overlap. Moreover, overlapping entities may have different expressions in each domain. Neglecting these two issues reduces prediction accuracy of cross-domain recommender systems in the target domain. To fully exploit partially overlapping entities and improve the accuracy of predictions, this paper presents a cross-domain recommender system based on kernel-induced knowledge transfer, called KerKT. Domain adaptation is used to adjust the feature spaces of overlapping entities, while diffusion kernel completion is used to correlate the non-overlapping entities between the two domains. With this approach, knowledge is effectively transferred through the overlapping entities, thus alleviating data sparsity issues.

","Consumers increasingly encounter recommender systems when making consumption decisions of all kinds. While numerous efforts have aimed to improve the quality of algorithm-generated recommendations, evidence has indicated that people often remain averse to superior algorithmic sources of information in favor of their own personal intuitions (a type II problem). The current work highlights an additional (type I) problem associated with the use of recommender systems: algorithm overdependence. Five experiments illustrate that, stemming from a belief that algorithms hold greater domain expertise, consumers surrender to algorithm-generated recommendations even when the recommendations are inferior. Counter to prior findings, this research indicates that consumers frequently depend too much on algorithm-generated recommendations, posing potential harms to their own well-being and leading them to play a role in propagating systemic biases that can influence other users. Given the rapidly expanding application of recommender systems across consumer domains, the authors believe that an appreciation and understanding of these risks is crucial to the effective guidance and development of recommendation systems that support consumer interests.",51

","In today’s digital world healthcare is one core area of the medical domain. A healthcare system is required to analyze a large amount of patient data which helps to derive insights and assist the prediction of diseases. This system should be intelligent in order to predict a health condition by analyzing a patient’s lifestyle, physical health records and social activities. The health recommender system (HRS) is becoming an important platform for healthcare services. In this context, health intelligent systems have become indispensable tools in decision making processes in the healthcare sector. Their main objective is to ensure the availability of the valuable information at the right time by ensuring information quality, trustworthiness, authentication and privacy concerns. As people use social networks to understand their health condition, so the health recommender system is very important to derive outcomes such as recommending diagnoses, health insurance, clinical pathway-based treatment methods and alternative medicines based on the patient’s health profile. Recent research which targets the utilization of large volumes of medical data while combining multimodal data from disparate sources is discussed which reduces the workload and cost in health care. In the healthcare sector, big data analytics using recommender systems have an important role in terms of decision-making processes with respect to a patient’s health. This paper gives a proposed intelligent HRS using Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM)-Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) deep learning method, which provides an insight into how big data analytics can be used for the implementation of an effective health recommender engine, and illustrates an opportunity for the health care industry to transition from a traditional scenario to a more personalized paradigm in a tele-health environment. By considering Root Square Mean Error (RSME) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) values, the proposed deep learning method (RBM-CNN) presents fewer errors compared to other approaches.",32

","OBJECTIVES
To determine the feasibility and acceptability of an Ayurveda/Yoga intervention for weight loss, using dual-diagnosis inclusion criteria, dual-paradigm outcomes, and a semistandardized protocol with tailoring according to the Ayurvedic constitution/imbalance profile of each participant.


DESIGN
Seventeen participants enrolled in a weekly intervention for 3 months. Outcome measurements were performed at baseline, postintervention, and 3 and 6 months follow-up.


SETTING
The intervention was conducted through the University of Arizona, Department of Family and Community Medicine from April through December 2012.


SUBJECTS
Participants included 2 men and 15 women recruited from the community of Tucson, AZ using flyers and hospital message boards. Seventeen enrolled and 12 participants provided complete follow-up data.


INTERVENTION
Participants met with an Ayurvedic practitioner twice monthly (six times) and followed semistandardized dietary guidelines with individual tailoring to address relevant psychophysiological imbalances obstructing weight loss and a standardized protocol of therapeutic yoga classes three times weekly with recommended home practice of two to four additional sessions.


OUTCOME MEASURES
Primary outcome was weight loss. Other biomedical outcomes included body mass index, body fat percentage, waist and hip circumference, waist to hip ratio, and blood pressure. Unique instruments were designed to collect data on outcomes associated with the Ayurvedic medical paradigm, including dietary changes by food qualities, mood/affect, relationships, and changes in Ayurvedic imbalance profiles.


RESULTS
Participants lost an average of 3.5 kg during the 3-month intervention. Weight loss at 3 and 6 months postintervention increased to an average of 5.6 kg and 5.9 kg, respectively. Participants who lost 3% of their body weight during the 12 week intervention, lost on average an additional 3% during the follow-up period. Psychosocial outcomes also improved. No additional services were provided to participants during the follow-up period.


CONCLUSIONS
A whole-systems Ayurvedic medicine and Yoga therapy approach provides a feasible promising noninvasive low-cost alternative to traditional weight loss interventions with potential added benefits associated with sustainable holistic lifestyle modification and positive psychosocial changes.",44

","Fc-gamma receptors (FcγR) are the cellular receptors for Immunoglobulin G (IgG). Upon binding of complexed IgG, FcγRs can trigger various cellular immune effector functions, thereby linking the adaptive and innate immune systems. In humans, six classic FcγRs are known: one high-affinity receptor (FcγRI) and five low-to-medium-affinity FcγRs (FcγRIIA, -B and -C, FcγRIIIA and -B). In this review we describe the five genes encoding the low-to-medium -affinity FcγRs (FCGR2A, FCGR2B, FCGR2C, FCGR3A, and FCGR3B), including well-characterized functionally relevant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), haplotypes as well as copy number variants (CNVs), which occur in distinct copy number regions across the locus. The evolution of the locus is also discussed. Importantly, we recommend a consistent nomenclature of genetic variants in the FCGR2/3 locus. Next, we focus on the relevance of genetic variation in the FCGR2/3 locus in auto-immune and auto-inflammatory diseases, highlighting pathophysiological insights that are informed by genetic association studies. Finally, we illustrate how specific FcγR variants relate to variation in treatment responses and prognosis amongst autoimmune diseases, cancer and transplant immunology, suggesting novel opportunities for personalized medicine.",1

","Background Exercise has physiologic and psychological benefits for cancer patients and survivors. Today, various exercises are recommended as adjunct to therapies for cancer patients and survivors. This study was conducted to develop a consensual core list of important knowledge items that primary healthcare providers and complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) practitioners need to know on the role of exercises and physical activities in stimulating anticancer immunity. Methods Knowledge items were collected following interviews with key contact experts (4 oncologists, 3 exercise and medicine specialists, 2 researchers, 2 cancer patients, and 3 survivors) and extensive literature review. The collected knowledge items were rated by 9 researchers who conducted research on exercise and cancer. A modified two-iterative Delphi technique was employed among a panel (n = 65) of healthcare providers and CAM practitioners to develop the consensual core list of knowledge items. Results Of the 49 knowledge items, consensus was achieved on 45 (91.8%) items in 6 categories. Of those, 9 (20.0%) were general items on recommending moderate to vigorous habitual exercises and physical activities. The rest of items were related to the effects of habitual exercises and physical activities on the functions of immune system and exposure to carcinogens 16 (35.6%), anticancer therapies 12 (26.7%), metastasis of cancer 3 (6.7%), metabolism within tumors 3 (6.7%), and myokines release 2 (4.4%). Conclusion Formal consensus was achieved for the first time on a core list of knowledge items on how exercises and physical activities might stimulate anticancer immunity. This core list might be considered at the time of developing training/educational interventions and/or continuing education for primary healthcare providers and CAM practitioners. Future studies are still needed to investigate if such consensual lists might improve congruence in cancer care continuum and improve survival rates and wellbeing of cancer patients and survivors.",6

","By ignoring the root causes of disease and neglecting to prioritize lifestyle measures for prevention, the medical community is placing people at harm. Advanced nations, influenced by a Western lifestyle, are in the midst of a health crisis, resulting largely from poor lifestyle choices. Epidemiologic, ecologic, and interventional studies have repeatedly indicated that most chronic illnesses, including cardiovascular disease, cancer, and type 2 diabetes, are the result of lifestyles fueled by poor nutrition and physical inactivity.In this article, we describe the practice of lifestyle medicine and its powerful effect on these modern instigators of premature disability and death. We address the economic benefits of prevention-based lifestyle medicine and its effect on our health care system: A system on the verge of bankruptcy. We recommend vital changes to a disastrous course. Many deaths and many causes of pain, suffering, and disability could be circumvented if the medical community could effectively implement and share the power of healthy lifestyle choices. We believe that lifestyle medicine should become the primary approach to the management of chronic conditions and, more importantly, their prevention. For future generations, for our own health, and for the Hippocratic Oath we swore to uphold (""First do no harm""), the medical community must take action. It is our hope that the information presented will inspire our colleagues to pursue lifestyle medicine research and incorporate such practices into their daily care of patients.

","BACKGROUND
As a prevalent metabolic disease, diabetes has different side effects and causes a wide range of co morbidity with a high rate of mortality. There is a need for certain interventions to manage this disease. Iranians usually have three main meals a day. Considering the special needs of diabetic patients and the possibility of hypoglycemia between the main meals, it is essential for these patients to eat something as a snack. Considering these conditions and the society's orientation towards modern technologies such as smart phones, designing mobile-based nutrition recommender systems can be helpful.


METHODS
The snack recommender system is a knowledge-based smart phone application. This study has focused on the development of a recommender system that combines artificial intelligence techniques and makes up a knowledge base according to the guidelines posed by the American Diabetes Association (ADA). The snack menu was recommended in accordance with the patient's favorites and conditions. The accuracy of the recommended menu was assessed in 2 steps. First, it was compared with the diet prescribed by three nutrition specialists. In the second step, system's suggested menu was evaluated by the data from 30 diabetic patients using a valid questionnaire.


RESULTS
The results of evaluating the snack recommender system by nutritionists showed that this system is capable of recommending various snacks according to the season (accuracy of 100%) and personal interests (accuracy of 90%) to diabetic patients. According to health nutritionists, the snacks suggested by this system are matched with Iranian culture. Moreover, the results revealed that a higher body mass index (BMI) makes the recommender system less sensitive to personal interests to suggest what is basically beneficial for one's health.


CONCLUSION
This study was a pioneering research to develop a more comprehensive dietary recommender system for diabetic patients which includes main meals as well. Patients found the system useful and were satisfied with the application. This system is believed to be able to help diabetic patients to take more healthy diet which leads to a better lifestyle.",28

","A recommender system aims to recommend items that a user is interested in among many items. The need for the recommender system has been expanded by the information explosion. Various approaches have been suggested for providing meaningful recommendations to users. One of the proposed approaches is to consider a recommender system as a Markov decision process (MDP) problem and try to solve it using reinforcement learning (RL). However, existing RL-based methods have an obvious drawback. To solve an MDP in a recommender system, they encountered a problem with the large number of discrete actions that bring RL to a larger class of problems. In this paper, we propose a novel RL-based recommender system. We formulate a recommender system as a gridworld game by using a biclustering technique that can reduce the state and action space significantly. Using biclustering not only reduces space but also improves the recommendation quality effectively handling the cold-start problem. In addition, our approach can provide users with some explanation why the system recommends certain items. Lastly, we examine the proposed algorithm on a real-world dataset and achieve a better performance than the widely used recommendation algorithm.",6

","With the prevalence of multimedia content on the Web, developing recommender solutions that can effectively leverage the rich signal in multimedia data is in urgent need. Owing to the success of deep neural networks in representation learning, recent advances on multimedia recommendation has largely focused on exploring deep learning methods to improve the recommendation accuracy. To date, however, there has been little effort to investigate the robustness of multimedia representation and its impact on the performance of multimedia recommendation. In this paper, we shed light on the robustness of multimedia recommender system. Using the state-of-the-art recommendation framework and deep image features, we demonstrate that the overall system is not robust, such that a small (but purposeful) perturbation on the input image will severely decrease the recommendation accuracy. This implies the possible weakness of multimedia recommender system in predicting user preference, and more importantly, the potential of improvement by enhancing its robustness. To this end, we propose a novel solution named Adversarial Multimedia Recommendation (AMR), which can lead to a more robust multimedia recommender model by using adversarial learning. The idea is to train the model to defend an adversary, which adds perturbations to the target image with the purpose of decreasing the model's accuracy. We conduct experiments on two representative multimedia recommendation tasks, namely, image recommendation and visually-aware product recommendation. Extensive results verify the positive effect of adversarial learning and demonstrate the effectiveness of our AMR method. Source codes are available in https://github.com/duxy-me/AMR.",7

","Recommender systems are used in variety of domains affecting people's lives. This has raised concerns about possible biases and discrimination that such systems might exacerbate. There are two primary kinds of biases inherent in recommender systems: observation bias and bias stemming from imbalanced data. Observation bias exists due to a feedback loop which causes the model to learn to only predict recommendations similar to previous ones. Imbalance in data occurs when systematic societal, historical, or other ambient bias is present in the data. In this paper, we address both biases by proposing a hybrid fairness-aware recommender system. Our model provides efficient and accurate recommendations by incorporating multiple user-user and item-item similarity measures, content, and demographic information, while addressing recommendation biases. We implement our model using a powerful and expressive probabilistic programming language called probabilistic soft logic. We experimentally evaluate our approach on a popular movie recommendation dataset, showing that our proposed model can provide more accurate and fairer recommendations, compared to a state-of-the art fair recommender system.",10

","This article seeks to review the Australian healthcare system and compare it to similar systems in other countries to highlight the main issues and problems. A literature search for articles relating to the Australian and other developed countries’ healthcare systems was conducted by using Google and the library of Victoria University, Melbourne. Data from the websites of the Commonwealth of Australia, the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, the Australian Productivity Commission, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and the World Bank have also been used. Although care within the Australian healthcare system is among the best in the world, there is a need to change the paradigm currently being used to measure the outcomes and allocate resources. The Australian healthcare system is potentially dealing with two main problems: (a) resource allocation, and (b) performance and patient outcomes improvements. An interdisciplinary research approach in the areas of performance measurement, quality and patient outcomes improvement could be adopted to discover new insights, by using the policy implementation error/efficiency and bureaucratic capacity. Hospital managers, executives and healthcare management practitioners could use an interdisciplinary approach to design new performance measurement models, in which financial performance, quality, healthcare and patient outcomes are blended in, for resource allocation and performance improvement. This article recommends that public policy implementation error and the bureaucratic capacity models be applied to healthcare to optimise the outcomes for the healthcare system in Australia. In addition, it highlights the need for evaluation of the current reimbursement method, freedom of choice to patients and a regular scrutiny of the appropriateness of care.",17

","Background Carthamus tinctorius L., known as Kafesheh (Persian) and safflower (English) is vastly utilized in Traditional Medicine for various medical conditions, namely dysmenorrhea, amenorrhea, postpartum abdominal pain and mass, trauma and pain of joints. It is largely used for flavoring and coloring purposes among the local population. Recent reviews have addressed the uses of the plant in various ethnomedical systems. Objective This review was an update to provide a summary on the botanical features, uses in Iranian folklore and modern medical applications of safflower. Methods A main database containing important early published texts written in Persian, together with electronic papers was established on ethnopharmacology and modern pharmacology of C. tinctorius. Literature review was performed on the years from 1937 to 2016 in Web of Science, PubMed, Scientific Information Database, Google Scholar, and Scopus for the terms “Kafesheh”, “safflower”, “Carthamus tinctorius”, and so forth. Results Safflower is an indispensable element of Iranian folklore medicine, with a variety of applications due to laxative effects. Also, it was recommended as treatment for rheumatism and paralysis, vitiligo and black spots, psoriasis, mouth ulcers, phlegm humor, poisoning, numb limbs, melancholy humor, and the like. According to the modern pharmacological and clinical examinations, safflower provides promising opportunities for the amelioration of myocardial ischemia, coagulation, thrombosis, inflammation, toxicity, cancer, and so forth. However, there have been some reports on its undesirable effects on male and female fertility. Most of these beneficial therapeutic effects were correlated to hydroxysafflor yellow A. Conclusion More attention should be drawn to the lack of a thorough phytochemical investigation. The potential implications of safflower based on Persian traditional medicine, such as the treatment of rheumatism and paralysis, vitiligo and black spots, psoriasis, mouth ulcers, phlegm humor, poisoning, numb limbs, and melancholy humor warrant further consideration.",14

","This article studies how a recommender system may incentivize users to learn about a product collaboratively. To improve the incentives for early exploration, the optimal design trades off fully transparent disclosure by selectively overrecommending the product (or “spamming”) to a fraction of users. Under the optimal scheme, the designer spams very little on a product immediately after its release but gradually increases its frequency; she stops it altogether when she becomes sufficiently pessimistic about the product. The recommender’s product research and intrinsic/naive users “seed” incentives for user exploration and determine the speed and trajectory of social learning. Potential applications for various Internet recommendation platforms and implications for review/ratings inflation are discussed.",19

","Data drive modern medicine. And our tools to analyze those data are growing ever more powerful. As health data are collected in greater and greater amounts, sophisticated algorithms based on those data can drive medical innovation, improve the process of care, and increase efficiency. Those algorithms, however, vary widely in quality. Some are accurate and powerful, while others may be riddled with errors or based on faulty science. When an opaque algorithm recommends an insulin dose to a diabetic patient, how do we know that dose is correct? Patients, providers, and insurers face substantial difficulties in identifying high-quality algorithms; they lack both expertise and proprietary information. How should we ensure that medical algorithms are safe and effective? Medical algorithms need regulatory oversight, but that oversight must be appropriately tailored. Unfortunately, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has suggested that it will regulate algorithms under its traditional framework, a relatively rigid system that is likely to stifle innovation and to block the development of more flexible, current algorithms. This Article draws upon ideas from the new governance movement to suggest a different path. FDA should pursue a more adaptive regulatory approach with requirements that developers disclose information underlying their algorithms. Disclosure would allow FDA oversight to be supplemented with evaluation by providers, hospitals, and insurers. This collaborative approach would supplement the agency's review with ongoing real-world feedback from sophisticated market actors. Medical algorithms have tremendous potential, but ensuring that such potential is developed in high-quality ways demands a careful balancing between public and private oversight, and a role for FDA that mediates--but does not dominate--the rapidly developing industry.",35

","The advancement in technology accelerated and opened availability of various alternatives to make a choice in every domain. In the era of big data it is a tedious and time consuming task to evaluate the features of a large amount of information provided to make a choice. One solution to ease this overload problem is building recommender system that can process a large amount of data and support users’ decision making ability. In this paper different traditional recommendation techniques, deep learning approaches for recommender system and survey of deep learning techniques on recommender system are presented. A variety of techniques have been proposed to perform recommendation, including content based, collaborative and hybrid recommenders. Due to the limitation of the traditional recommendation methods in obtaining accurate result a deep learning approach is introduced both for collaborative and content based approaches that will enable the model to learn different features of users and items automatically to improve accuracy of recommendation. Even though deep learning poses a great impact in various areas, applying the model to a recommender systems have not been fully exploited. With the help of the advantage of deep learning in modeling different types of data, deep recommender systems can better understand users’ demand to further improve quality of recommendation.",15

","BACKGROUND
Polypharmacy is now a frequent aspect and reality of current medicine practice, driven by managing multiple comorbidities, especially in older adults. However and unfortunately, polypharmacy can expose patients to adverse drug reactions, and drug-drug or drug-disease interactions. On the other hand, clinicians are often hesitant to add new drugs to complex regimens even when recommended by evidence-based medicine and guidelines. In addition, there is frequently a failure to assess which medications might not be beneficial and may therefore be stopped.


METHOD
Cardiovascular disease prevalence is increasing despite the efforts to prevent this with pandemics of obesity and diabetes as leading causes. The healthcare system is facing an increasing number of cardiovascular diseases in older patients with multiple comorbidities. New cardiovascular guidelines encourage multiple drug use to control these conditions and improve mortality and morbidity. However, use of multiple drugs can lead to inappropriate drug interactions and increased adverse outcomes. On the other hand, the so-called polypill has been proposed as a means to decrease the burden of multiple medications as well as increase cardiovascular disease prevention.


CONCLUSION
This review discusses multiple issues of polypharmacy and its challenges, with a focus on cardiovascular diseases.",35

","Research paper recommenders emerged over the last decade to ease finding publications relating to researchers’ area of interest. The challenge was not just to provide researchers with very rich publications at any time, any place and in any form but to also offer the right publication to the right researcher in the right way. Several approaches exist in handling paper recommender systems. However, these approaches assumed the availability of the whole contents of the recommending papers to be freely accessible, which is not always true due to factors such as copyright restrictions. This paper presents a collaborative approach for research paper recommender system. By leveraging the advantages of collaborative filtering approach, we utilize the publicly available contextual metadata to infer the hidden associations that exist between research papers in order to personalize recommendations. The novelty of our proposed approach is that it provides personalized recommendations regardless of the research field and regardless of the user’s expertise. Using a publicly available dataset, our proposed approach has recorded a significant improvement over other baseline methods in measuring both the overall performance and the ability to return relevant and useful publications at the top of the recommendation list.",36

","Motivation As we move towards an era of precision medicine, the ability to predict patient-specific drug responses in cancer based on molecular information such as gene expression data represents both an opportunity and a challenge. In particular, methods are needed that can accommodate the high-dimensionality of data to learn interpretable models capturing drug response mechanisms, as well as providing robust predictions across datasets. Results We propose a method based on ideas from “recommender systems” (CaDRReS) that predicts cancer drug responses for unseen cell-lines/patients based on learning projections for drugs and cell-lines into a latent “pharmacogenomic” space. Comparisons with other proposed approaches for this problem based on large public datasets (CCLE, GDSC) shows that CaDRReS provides consistently good models and robust predictions even across unseen patient-derived cell-line datasets. Analysis of the pharmacogenomic spaces inferred by CaDRReS also suggests that they can be used to understand drug mechanisms, identify cellular subtypes, and further characterize drug-pathway associations.

","Background What is the next frontier for computer-tailored health communication (CTHC) research? In current CTHC systems, study designers who have expertise in behavioral theory and mapping theory into CTHC systems select the variables and develop the rules that specify how the content should be tailored, based on their knowledge of the targeted population, the literature, and health behavior theories. In collective-intelligence recommender systems (hereafter recommender systems) used by Web 2.0 companies (eg, Netflix and Amazon), machine learning algorithms combine user profiles and continuous feedback ratings of content (from themselves and other users) to empirically tailor content. Augmenting current theory-based CTHC with empirical recommender systems could be evaluated as the next frontier for CTHC. Objective The objective of our study was to uncover barriers and challenges to using recommender systems in health promotion. Methods We conducted a focused literature review, interviewed subject experts (n=8), and synthesized the results. Results We describe (1) limitations of current CTHC systems, (2) advantages of incorporating recommender systems to move CTHC forward, and (3) challenges to incorporating recommender systems into CTHC. Based on the evidence presented, we propose a future research agenda for CTHC systems.

","With recommended screening for hepatitis C among the 1945–1965 birth cohort and advent of novel highly effective therapies, little is known about health disparities in the Hepatitis C care cascade. Our objective was to evaluate hepatitis C screening rates and linkage to care, among patients who test positive, at our large integrated health system. We used electronic medical records to retrospectively identify patients, in the birth cohort, who were seen in 21 Internal Medicine clinics from July 2014 to June 2015. Patients previously screened for hepatitis C and those with established disease were excluded. We studied patients’ sociodemographic and medical conditions along with provider-specific factors associated with likelihood of screening. Patients who tested positive for HCV antibody were reviewed to assess appropriate linkage to care and treatment. Of 40,561 patients who met inclusion criteria, 21.3% (8657) were screened, 1.3% (109) tested positive, and 30% (30/100) completed treatment. Multivariate logistic regression showed that African American race, male gender, electronic health engagement, residency teaching clinic visit, and having more than one clinic visit were associated with higher odds of screening. Patients had a significant decrease in the likelihood of screening with sequential interval increase in their Charlson comorbidity index. When evaluating hepatitis C treatment in patients who screened positive, electronic health engagement was associated with higher odds of treatment whereas Medicaid insurance was associated with significantly lower odds. This study shows that hepatitis C screening rates and linkage to care continue to be suboptimal with a significant impact of multiple sociodemographic and insurance factors. Electronic health engagement emerges as a tool in linking patients to the hepatitis C care cascade.",28

","In this paper, we propose an automated and scalable garment recommender system using real-time in-store videos that can improve the experiences of garment shoppers and increase product sales. The video-based automated recommender (VAR) system is based on observations that garment shoppers tend to try on garments and evaluate themselves in front of store mirrors. Combining state-of-the-art computer vision techniques with marketing models of consumer preferences, the system automatically identifies shoppers’ preferences based on their reactions and uses that information to make meaningful personalized recommendations. First, the system uses a camera to capture a shopper’s behavior in front of the mirror to make inferences about her preferences based on her facial expressions and the part of the garment she is examining at each time point. Second, the system identifies shoppers with preferences similar to the focal customer from a database of shoppers whose preferences, purchasing, and/or consideration decisions are known. Finally, recommendations are made to the focal customer based on the preferences, purchasing, and/or consideration decisions of these like-minded shoppers. Each of the three steps can be implemented with several variations, and a retailing chain can choose the specific configuration that best serves its purpose. In this paper, we present an empirical test that compares one specific type of VAR system implementation against two alternative, nonautomated personal recommender systems: self-explicated conjoint (SEC) and self-evaluation after try-on (SET). The results show that VAR consistently outperforms SEC and SET. A second empirical study demonstrates the feasibility of VAR in real-time applications. Participants in the second study enjoyed the VAR experience, and almost all of them tried on the recommended garments. VAR should prove to be a valuable tool for both garment retailers and shoppers.Data, as supplemental material, are available at http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mksc.2016.0984 .",7

","Fifteen years ago, in its landmark report, To Err Is Human: Building a Safer Health System (1), the Institute of Medicine (IOM) dramatically exposed the issue of patient safety in health care. Stating the obviousthat human beings make errorsbut highlighting the theretofore rarely discussed fact that those of us in health care make errors, the report began a quiet revolution in the way health care organizations address safety and quality. To Err Is Human was followed shortly by a second report, Crossing the Quality Chasm: A New Health System for the 21st Century (2), which set a course to close the gulf between high-quality health care and the care many people receive in practice. Although To Err Is Human mentioned diagnostic error as an issue, neither report devoted substantial analysis to it nor made recommendations related to it. Also surprising is that there has been little attention paid to the issue in the interim. This lack of attention motivated an eclectic group of 10 organizations and individuals (see the Financial Support section at the end of the text) to ask the IOM, the health arm of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, to evaluate the existing knowledge on diagnostic error and to propose solutions in a broad array of areas and with a diverse group of stakeholders. The resulting report, Improving Diagnosis in Health Care (3), was released in September 2015. Following are the 3 major themes: First, it exposes a critical areadiagnostic errorthat has received insufficient attention. There are several reasons why diagnostic error has been underappreciated, even though the correct diagnosis is a critical aspect of health care. The data on diagnostic error are sparse, few reliable measures exist, and the error is often identified only in retrospect. Yet the best estimates indicate that all of us will probably experience a meaningful diagnostic error in our lifetime. Perhaps the most important contribution of this report is to highlight that issue and to direct discussion among patients, health care professionals, organizations, researchers, and policymakers on what should be done. Second, patients are central to the solution. The report defines diagnostic error from the patient's viewpoint as the failure to (a) establish an accurate and timely explanation of the patient's health problem(s) or (b) communicate that explanation to the patient [emphasis added]. The report's first goal centers on the need to establish partnerships with patients and their families to improve diagnosis, and several recommendations address this goal. Third, diagnosis is a collaborative effort. A single physician contemplating a patient's presentation and discerning a diagnosis is often a stereotype; the diagnostic process often involves intra- and interprofessional teamwork. Further, diagnostic error is not always due to human error; it often occurs because of errors in the health care system. The complexity of health and disease and the increasing complexity of health care demands collaboration among and between health care professionals, as well as with patients and their families. The committee's visualization of the diagnostic process illustrates its collaborative, iterative, and complex nature (Figure). Figure. The committee's visualization of the diagnostic process illustrates its complexity and the need for collaboration among clinicians, patients, and their families to achieve accurate, timely diagnosis. The committee identifies 4 types of information-gathering activities in the diagnostic process: clinical history and interview, physical examination, diagnostic testing, and referral and consultation. Throughout the process, there is an iterative cycle of information gathering, information integration and interpretation, and developing a working diagnosis. A key responsibility is communicationthroughout the diagnostic process, patients need an explanation of their health problem, along with an understanding of the degree of uncertainty involved, communicated each time the working diagnosis is revised. Treatment can often inform the diagnostic process and refine the diagnosis; in addition, clinicians need to identify treatment-related health problems. Outcomes from the diagnostic process can inform efforts to strengthen the diagnostic process and improve outcomes for patients and their families. In addition to these major themes, the report highlights the following key issues that must be addressed to reduce diagnostic errors: Health care professional education and training does not take fully into account advances in the learning sciences. The report emphasizes training in clinical reasoning, teamwork, and communication. Health information technology, while potentially a boon to health care quality, is often a barrier to effective clinical care in its current form. The report makes several recommendations to improve the utility of health information technology in the diagnostic process specifically and the clinical process generally. Data on diagnostic error are sparse. The report recommends, in addition to specified research, the development of processes to monitor the diagnostic process and to identify, learn from, and reduce diagnostic error. The health care work system and culture do not sufficiently support the diagnostic process. Echoing previous IOM work, the current report also recommends development of an organizational culture that values open discussion and feedback on diagnostic performance. The report highlights the increasingly important role of radiologists and pathologists as members of the diagnostic team. There were also areas where the committee wished the report could go further, but found that data are currently insufficient to support strong recommendations. One of those areas is the payment system, which is now evolving from fee-for-service to more value- and population-based methods. Research on the effects of payment on diagnosis is needed. Another area of interest is medical liability: The report recommends the adoption of communication and resolution programs as a key lever to improve disclosure of diagnostic errors to patients and to facilitate improved organizational learning from these events. Other approaches to resolution of medical injuries, such as safe harbors for adherence to clinical practice guidelines and administrative health courts, hold promise. However, we need more data on their effect on the diagnostic process, and the report recommends demonstration projects to expand the knowledge base in these areas. A final area of potential controversy is the measurement of diagnostic errors for public reporting and accountability purposes. The committee believed that, given the lack of agreement on what constitutes a diagnostic error, the paucity of hard data, and the lack of valid measurement approaches, the time was simply not ripe to call for mandatory reporting. Instead, it was considered appropriate at this time to leverage the intrinsic motivation of health care professionals to improve diagnostic performance and to treat diagnostic error in the same way as quality improvement efforts by health care organizations. Better identification, analysis, and implementation of approaches to improve diagnosis and to reduce diagnostic error are needed throughout all settings of health care.",26

","Since antiquity, with respect to advancing the care of the injured, “war has been a very efficient schoolmaster.” Innovation in trauma care has once again accelerated, spurred by the significant burden of injury from more than a decade of war in Afghanistan and Iraq. During those recent wars, the percentage of wounded service members who died of their injuries reached the lowest point in recorded wartime history—9.3% in Afghanistan and Iraq compared with 23% during the Vietnam War. Effective bleeding-control measures, improved resuscitation techniques, and aggressive neurocritical care interventions are among many advances that saved lives on the battlefield that otherwise would have been lost. For example, an estimated 1000 to 2000 lives were saved by widespread use of tourniquets. Military medical forces did not begin the recent wars with these capabilities. These interventions developed in response to the urgency from increasing numbers of US service members who died of potentially survivable injuries. That urgency was inconsistent with reliance on slow and costly clinical trials to inform improvements in trauma care practices. It drove the Military Health System and its nascent Joint Trauma System to embrace, instead, a culture of continuous performance improvement and a more agile approach to advancing combat casualty care. The Military Health System calls this pragmatic, more rapid model for learning “focused empiricism.” Focused empiricism is aligned with the characteristics of a learning health system articulated in the 2012 Institute of Medicine report Best Care at Lower Cost. For example, the Joint Trauma System digitally captures and routinely uses patient care data from its registry to identify trends and answer clinical questions, enabling care practices to evolve incrementally based on the best available evidence until higher-quality data can be generated. In effect, military medicine put the learning health system framework into practice before the Institute of Medicine described it. However, questions have arisen as to how the military’s learning trauma system can be improved, sustained, and expanded across the US Department of Defense. In addition, there are questions about how thoroughly and rapidly wartime trauma lessons learned can be applied in the civilian sector, where the need, if not the sense of urgency, is at least as great. In Afghanistan and Iraq, approximately 6850 service member lives have been lost over the last 15 years. In the United States there are nearly 150 000 deaths from trauma each year, and injury is the third leading cause of death, accounting for more years of life lost than any other cause. A new report* from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, of which the former Institute of Medicine is now part, clarifies the components of a learning health system necessary to ensure continuous improvement in military and civilian trauma care. The report also provides recommendations on how lessons from the military’s experiences in Afghanistan and Iraq can be sustained and built on for future combat operations and translated more effectively into the civilian care system. The report concludes that military and civilian trauma systems are inextricably linked, even if leaders sometimes seem unaware of that. It asserts that continued progress in trauma care capability and learning capacity will require better conduits for the continuous and seamless exchange of knowledge between the 2 sectors. Military and civilian trauma care and learning will be optimized together, or not at all. The committee recommends that a national strategy and a joint military-civilian approach for improving trauma care be developed to ensure the delivery of optimal trauma care to save the lives of Americans injured both within the United States and on the battlefield. To guide such an approach, the committee identified strengths and gaps in progress in the military and civilian sectors, using the following elements of a learning trauma care system as a diagnostic lens. *National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine.

","In this article, the authors describe an initiative that established an infrastructure to manage quality and safety efforts throughout a complex health care system and that improved performance on core measures for acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, pneumonia, surgical care, and children’s asthma. The Johns Hopkins Medicine Board of Trustees created a governance structure to establish health care system-wide oversight and hospital accountability for quality and safety efforts throughout Johns Hopkins Medicine. The Armstrong Institute for Patient Safety and Quality was formed; institute leaders used a conceptual model nested in a fractal infrastructure to implement this initiative to improve performance at two academic medical centers and three community hospitals, starting in March 2012. The initiative aimed to achieve ≥ 96% compliance on seven inpatient process-of-care core measures and meet the requirements for the Delmarva Foundation and Joint Commission awards. The primary outcome measure was the percentage of patients at each hospital who received the recommended process of care. The authors compared health system and hospital performance before (2011) and after (2012, 2013) the initiative. The health system achieved ≥ 96% compliance on six of the seven targeted measures by 2013. Of the five hospitals, four received the Delmarva Foundation award and two received The Joint Commission award in 2013. The authors argue that, to improve quality and safety, health care systems should establish a system-wide governance structure and accountability process.

Most of the current food suggestion applications offer just generic advices that are not tailored to the user's personal taste. To tackle this issue, we propose in this paper a novel food recommender system that provides high quality and personalized recipe suggestions. These recommendations are generated by leveraging a data set of users' preferences expressed in the form of users' ratings and tags, which signal the food's ingredients or features that the users like. Our empirical evaluation shows that the proposed recommendation technique significantly outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms. We have found that using tags in food recommendation algorithms can significantly increase the prediction accuracy, i.e., the match of the predicted preferences with the true user's preferred recipes. Furthermore, our user study shows that our system prototype is of high usability.",28

The IoT has great potential in several service domains including cultural, educational, or medical areas. We consider a recommendation technique suitable for the IoT-based service. A personalized recommender system often relies on user preferences for better suggestions. We notice that we need a different recommendation approach in the IoT platform. While the conventional recommendation approaches rely on user preferences provided by users, these approaches may not be suitable for the IoT environment. The conventional systems utilize user ratings for items to compose recommendation list. This implies that the systems require additional user activities such as adding their preferences. We notice that the IoT environment can naturally provide user information such as users’ item selection history without users’ additional actions. We propose a recommendation model that does not require users’ additional actions and is more suitable for the IoT environment. We examine the usability of the bandwagon effect to build a new recommender system based on users’ selection history. We first consider the bandwagon effects in movie recommendation domain and show its usefulness for the IoT. We then suggest how to use the bandwagon effect in recommender systems with IoT.",11

","The clinical therapeutics of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) constitutes a complicated process which involves theory, diagnosis, and formula prescription with specific herbal dosage. Zhang Zhong-Jing's classic work, Treatise on Febrile and Miscellaneous Diseases, has been influencing TCM practice for almost 2000 years. However, during this extended period of time in Chinese history, the Chinese weight measurement system experienced noticeable changes. This change in the weight measurement system inevitably, and perhaps even negatively, affected TCM herbal dosage determination and treatment outcome. Thus, in modern society, a full understanding of the accuracy of herbal dose selection has a critical importance in the TCM daily practice of delivering the best treatment to the patients suffering from different illnesses. In the 973 Project of the Chinese National Basic Research Program, expert consensus on classic TCM formula dose conversion has been reached based on extensive literature review and discussion on the dose-effect relationship of classic TCM formulas. One ""liang"" in classic TCM formulas is equivalent to 13.8 g. However, based on many TCM basic and clinical studies of variable herbal formula prescriptions and herbal drug preparations, the rule of one liang equals 13.8 g should be adjusted according to different disease conditions. Recommended by the committee on TCM formula dose-effect relationship of the China Association of Chinese Medicine and the World Federation of Chinese Medicine Societies, the following expert consensus has been reached: (i) One liang converts to 6-9 g for the severely and critically ill patients. (ii) One liang converts to 3-6 g for the patients suffering from chronic diseases. (iii) One liang converts to 1-3 g in preventive medicine. The above conversions should be used as a future TCM practice guideline. Using this recommended guideline should enhance the effectiveness of daily TCM practice.",14

","Context: Preventive care is a basic rule in current medical practice and traditional Persian medicine (TPM) scholars have introduced a large amount of publications in this valued field. According to TPM principles, healthy stomach has a significant role in providing a fit body and herbal medicines are capable of helping stomach perform this role. Evidence Acquisition: A wide-ranging search in main TPM books and web engines was performed to compare preventive care in gastrointestinal (GI) diseases through a librarian review study. Results: There is a close interaction between GI system and other body systems; any ailment in a system could result in dysfunction of stomach and vice versa. There are various herbal medicines that help achieving a healthy stomach following a seven-part preventive rule and in this article, we briefly reviewed some of them such as amla, clove, lemon, black mustard, saffron, ginger, aloe, and mastic. Conclusions: Following a simple seven-part rule of healthy stomach will result in balanced GI function and a healthy body. Properly consumption of recommended TPM herbal medicines could reinforce the stomach and a healthy GI system through preventive mechanisms.",54

","The needs for life-long learning and the rapid development of information technologies promote the development of various types of online Community of Practices (CoPs). In online CoPs, bounded rationality and metacognition are two major issues, especially when learners face information overload and there is no knowledge authority within the learning environment. This study proposes a hybrid, trust-based recommender system to mitigate above learning issues in online CoPs. A case study was conducted using Stack Overflow data to test the recommender system. Important findings include: (1) comparing with other social community platforms, learners in online CoPs have stronger social relations and tend to interact with a smaller group of people only; (2) the hybrid algorithm can provide more accurate recommendations than celebrity-based and content-based algorithm and; (3) the proposed recommender system can facilitate the formation of personalized learning communities.",33

","In July 2014, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) Committee on the Governance and Financing of Graduate Medical Education released its report calling for a major overhaul of the financing of graduate medical education (GME). Several national organizations with an interest in GME faulted the report on the basis that the IOM Committee recommendations would worsen physician shortages. However, this conclusion is based on two questionable assumptions: first, that the nation is already facing a general physician shortage; and second, that the IOM Committee recommendations would make shortages worse. The author argues that although some communities and specialties do face shortages, currently and in the future a general national physician shortage is unlikely. Reasons cited include changes in the delivery system with an increased focus on efficiency and effectiveness; the increased use of interprofessional teams facilitated by the increasing supply of nurse practitioners, physician assistants and other health professionals; and technological advances. The author concludes that the IOM Committee recommendations would support an increase in GME positions in locations and specialties where there is a documented need, in effect removing the current cap on Medicare-funded GME positions. Given the current fiscal environment, the approach recommended by the IOM Committee—steady funding levels but improved targeting to meet documented needs—may be the best strategy for maintaining GME funds and meeting the nation’s physician workforce needs.",29

This system integrates emotional fashion themes and human perception on personalized body shapes and professional designers' knowledge. The corresponding perceptual data are systematically collected from professional using sensory evaluation techniques. The perceptual data of consumers and designers are formalized mathematically using fuzzy sets and fuzzy relations. The complex relation between human body measurements and basic sensory descriptors, provided by designers, is modeled using fuzzy decision trees. The fuzzy decision trees constitute an empirical model based on learning data measured and evaluated on a set of representative samples. The complex relation between basic sensory descriptors and fashion themes, given by consumers, is modeled using fuzzy cognitive maps. The combination of the two models can provide more complete information to the fashion recommender system, making it possible to evaluate if a specific body shape is relevant to a desired emotional fashion theme and which garment design scheme can improve the image of the body shape. The proposed system has been validated in a customized design and mass market selection through the evaluations of target consumers and fashion experts using a method frequently used in marketing study.",2

","Recommender systems aim at filtering large amounts of information for users, providing them with those pieces of information which better meet their preferences or needs. Such systems have been traditionally used in diverse areas, such as e‐commerce or tourism. Within this context, group recommender systems address the problem of generating recommendations for groups of users who might have different interests. Although different aggregation processes have been extensively utilized in real‐life applications to generate group recommendations, such processes do not guarantee that the list of products recommended to the group reflect a high agreement level among its members' individual preferences. Given the need for considering the added value of obtaining group recommendations under a high agreement level, this paper presents a novel group recommender system methodology that attempts to reach a high level of consensus among individual recommendations of group members. To do this, and inspired by existing group decision‐making approaches in the literature, a consensus reaching process is carried out to bring such individual recommendations closer to each other before delivering the group recommendations.",33

","systems (e.g., Amazon.com) provide users with tailored products and services, which have the potential to induce user privacy concerns. Although system designers have been actively developing algorithms to introduce user control mechanisms, it remains unclear whether such control is effective in alleviating privacy concerns. It also is unclear how data type affects this relationship. To determine the psychological mechanisms of user privacy concerns in a recommender system, we conducted a scenario-based online experiment (N = 385). Users' privacy concerns were measured in relation to different data input (explicit vs. implicit) and control (present vs. absent) scenarios. Results show that a control mechanism can effectively reduce users' concerns over implicit user data input (i.e., purchase history) but not over explicit user data input (i.e., product ratings). We also demonstrate that control can influence privacy concerns via users' perceived value of disclosure. These findings question the effectiveness of user control mechanisms in recommender systems with explicit data input. Additionally, our item categorization provides a reference for future personalized recommendations and future analyses.",19

Furthermore, the actual implementation of a recommendation algorithm sometimes diverges considerably from the well-known ideal formulation due to manual tuning and modifications observed to work better in some situations. RiVal - a recommender system evaluation toolkit - allows for complete control of the different evaluation dimensions that take place in any experimental evaluation of a recommender system: data splitting, definition of evaluation strategies, and computation of evaluation metrics.

","BACKGROUND
Anorexia is a significant problem in patients approaching the end of life, for which corticosteroids are widely prescribed. It is not clear which regimen is the most safe and effective for this indication.


OBJECTIVE
The study objective was to identify the evidence for the use of corticosteroids, and the most safe and effective dosing regimen for management of anorexia in palliative care patients.


METHODS
A search of MEDLINE and CINAHL was carried out to identify original studies relevant to this question. These were reviewed against inclusion criteria and articles for inclusion were identified. Data was extracted and a narrative analysis was carried out. Subjects were adult patients with life-limiting diagnoses prescribed corticosteroids for anorexia in any care setting. Quality of studies was assessed using the system used by the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network for grading evidence.


RESULTS
Eight articles were identified that met the inclusion criteria. The corticosteroid drugs and dosing regimens used were wide ranging, and a variety of tools were used to assess appetite within these studies. All studies showed improvement in appetite with the corticosteroid used, although this did not always reach statistical significance. It was not possible to identify the most effective corticosteroid drug, dose, or duration of treatment from the identified studies: the best quality evidence was for an eight-week course of intravenous methylprednisolone; however the studies using this regimen had the highest attrition rates.


CONCLUSIONS
Corticosteroids are beneficial in treating anorexia in palliative care patients with malignancies; however there is no evidence for their use in anorexia due to end-stage nonmalignant disease. There is insufficient evidence to recommend any particular corticosteroid drug over another, or to recommend a dosing regimen.",35

","Traditional recommender systems minimize prediction error with respect to users' choices. Recent studies have shown that recommender systems have a positive effect on the provider's revenue. In this paper we show that by providing a set of recommendations different than the one perceived best according to user acceptance rate, the recommendation system can further increase the business' utility (e.g. revenue), without any significant drop in user satisfaction. Indeed, the recommendation system designer should have in mind both the user, whose taste we need to reveal, and the business, which wants to promote specific content. We performed a large body of experiments comparing a commercial state-of-the-art recommendation engine with a modified recommendation list, which takes into account the utility (or revenue) which the business obtains from each suggestion that is accepted by the user. We show that the modified recommendation list is more desirable for the business, as the end result gives the business a higher utility (or revenue). To study possible reduce in satisfaction by providing the user worse suggestions, we asked the users how they perceive the list of recommendation that they received. Differences in user satisfaction between the lists is negligible, and not statistically significant. We also uncover a phenomenon where movie consumers prefer watching and even paying for movies that they have already seen in the past than movies that are new to them.",22

It is used for dental care, antiulcer, and possesses anti-inflammatory properties. In addition, various parts of S. persica are being used as food, fruits and fodder. S. persica aqueous extract and methyl alcohol extract were prepared and tested against selected pathogenic microbes: Staphylococcus aureus, S. mutans, Lactobacillus acifophilus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, by standard protocol. The aqueous extract showed significant inhibition in the growth of all pathogens tested in the current study. However, S. persica water extract was found to possess profound inhibitory activity against Staphylococcus species as compared to other extracts. Methyl alcohol extract was more active against L. acifophilus and P. aeruginosa. The results indicate promising antibacterial activity of S. persica root extract and recommend further study on its efficacy and safety.

","BACKGROUND
Analysing the evidence generated over decades, the World Health Report 2008 recommended the expansion of primary health care (PHC) to achieve better population health, higher equity and lower costs. Over the last two decades, the Iranian model of PHC has resulted in population health indices that match the best in the region. Despite the extensive PHC networks in rural areas, there was an expansion of private outpatient care and hospital-based services. This model has been inadequate to meet the evolving health needs of the population and increasingly difficult to afford. In response, a family medicine (FM) programme has been implemented since August 2005, funded through Behbar, a model of social insurance. In this paper, we aim to identify facilitators of and barriers to implementation of FM in Iran.


METHODS
Data were collected between November 2006 and May 2007 through semi-structured interviews at national (19 interviews), provincial (9) and local (43) levels, and through a purposive document analysis. The framework approach was used for analysing interviews. Document analysis followed a narrative contextual framework. We interpreted data using an interpretive framework consisting of multiple streams and network theories.


RESULTS
The introduction of Behbar provided FM advocates with the opportunity to place FM on the policy agenda. They skillfully coupled the two policies and defined FM as the only solution to fulfill Behbar. However, the manner in which policy was formed was the main obstacle to desired FM implementation.


CONCLUSION
The interpretive framework links the concept of outreach to the poor and enhancing equity to rationing health services at a particularly opportune moment in Iran. However, using windows of opportunity to implement a major policy change, if it results in sacrifices in planning and preparedness, may harm the policy and the future success in achieving its objectives.",46

","Typical conversational recommender systems support interactive strategies that are hard-coded in advance and followed rigidly during a recommendation session. In fact, Reinforcement Learning techniques can be used in order to autonomously learn an optimal (user-adaptive) strategy, basically by exploiting some information encoded as features of a state representation. In this regard, it is important to determine the set of relevant state features for a given recommendation task. In this paper, we address the issue of feature relevancy, and determine the relevancy of adding four different features to a baseline representation. We show that adding a feature might not always be beneficial, and that the relevancy could be influenced by the user behavior. The results motivate the application of our approach online, in order to acquire the right mixture of online user behavior for addressing the relevancy problem. 1 Background and Motivation Recommender systems [Resnick and Varian, 1997] are online applications that assist users in their informationseeking tasks by offering personalized product recommendations during an interaction session. In order to support more interactive sessions, conversational recommender systems [Ricci et al., 2003; Thompson et al., 2004; Shimazu, 2001] have been recently proposed. These systems adopt the conversation style of real-life dialogues in order to guide users through complex product spaces. Mainly, at each dialogue stage, the system selects one from amongst a set of available system actions, e.g., recommend some product, ask the user for some information etc. The particular action selection is specified by the system’s recommendation strategy. For instance, suppose that a conversational recommender is queried for hotels that would suit the user preferences. Then, it could employ the following two strategies (among many others): 1) initially query the user in detail for her preferences, in order to extract a small product subset, or 2) recommend a set of products, and exploit the user feedback to refine future recommendations. Conversational systems typically employ a rigid strategy, i.e., one which is hard-coded inside the system and followed rigidly during a session [Ricci et al., 2003; Thompson et al., 2004; Shimazu, 2001]. A limitation of this approach is that there could be numerous rigid strategies for a given recommendation task. Furthermore, as system designers rely on intuition and previous experience in order to select a strategy, it is is possible that they shall have to evaluate several strategies before they discover a (almost) “good” one. This is an infeasible process in terms of budget, time, task force etc. These limitations would be tamed if conversational systems could be capable of determining by themselves the best (optimal) strategy for assisting the users. In a previous paper [Ricci and Mahmood, 2007], we have tackled these requirements by proposing a new type of recommender system which is able to autonomously improve an initial strategy in order to learn and adopt an optimal one. We validate our approach by applying it within the NutKing travel recommender system [Ricci andMahmood, 2007], and by improving NutKing’s (current) rigid strategy in order to learn an optimal one. We learn the strategy through the Reinforcement Learning (RL) paradigm [Sutton and Barto, 1998] in the context of the Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework (we avoid a lengthy explanation due to space constraints). Briefly, our system, at each stage of the session, observes the current state (or situation) of the user and the session activity. In one or more states (labeled as System Decision Points (SDPs)), multiple actions could be available for execution. The system executes these different actions as the interaction proceeds, and in return, receives a numerical reward informing it of the action’s acceptability for the user. As the interaction continues, the system learns to maximize the reward it receives in each possible state, i.e., it learns to avoid the unacceptable actions and to take the acceptable ones, until it learns the optimal action in each state, i.e., the optimal policy (strategy). Also, in the non-SDP states, only a single action is available which we consider as the optimal action. The optimal behavior is hence characterized by information in the observed state, which is represented as a combination of feature values. Considering that online user behavior is generally detailed and complex, the selection of the relevant state features for a given recommendation task becomes quite crucial. In this paper, we address several issues related to the feature relevancy problem. We introduce two relevancy criteria, and use them to determine the relevancy for four different feature sets (or state representations). We show that adding a feature might not always be relevant for a given task. We also investigate relevancy across different (simulated) user behaviors models, and show that relevancy is influenced by the user behavior. These results motivate the application of our approach in an online context, where we will be able to acquire behavior for a real user population, and to learn an optimal policy for this population.",41

","Since coronavirus has shown up, inaccessibility of legitimate clinical resources is at its peak, like the shortage of specialists and healthcare workers, lack of proper equipment and medicines etc. The entire medical fraternity is in distress, which results in numerous individual's demise. Due to unavailability, individuals started taking medication independently without appropriate consultation, making the health condition worse than usual. As of late, machine learning has been valuable in numerous applications, and there is an increase in innovative work for automation. This paper intends to present a drug recommender system that can drastically reduce specialists heap. In this research, we build a medicine recommendation system that uses patient reviews to predict the sentiment using various vectorization processes like Bow, TF-IDF, Word2Vec, and Manual Feature Analysis, which can help recommend the top drug for a given disease by different classification algorithms. The predicted sentiments were evaluated by precision, recall, f1score, accuracy, and AUC score. The results show that classifier LinearSVC using TF-IDF vectorization outperforms all other models with 93% accuracy.",9

Based on this framework, we collect 6 commonly used human-annotated CRS datasets and implement 19 models that include advanced techniques such as graph neural networks and pre-training models. Besides, our toolkit provides a series of automatic evaluation protocols and a human-machine interaction interface to evaluate and compare different CRS methods.

","Recently, recommender systems have achieved promising performances and become one of the most widely used web applications. However, recommender systems are often trained on highly sensitive user data, thus potential data leakage from recommender systems may lead to severe privacy problems. In this paper, we make the first attempt on quantifying the privacy leakage of recommender systems through the lens of membership inference. In contrast with traditional membership inference against machine learning classifiers, our attack faces two main differences. First, our attack is on the user-level but not on the data sample-level. Second, the adversary can only observe the ordered recommended items from a recommender system instead of prediction results in the form of posterior probabilities. To address the above challenges, we propose a novel method by representing users from relevant items. Moreover, a shadow recommender is established to derive the labeled training data for training the attack model. Extensive experimental results show that our attack framework achieves a strong performance. In addition, we design a defense mechanism to effectively mitigate the membership inference threat of recommender systems.",19

","Recent recommender systems have started to employ knowledge distillation, which is a model compression technique distilling knowledge from a cumbersome model (teacher) to a compact model (student), to reduce inference latency while maintaining performance. The state-of-the-art methods have only focused on making the student model to accurately imitate the predictions of the teacher model. They have a limitation in that the prediction results incompletely reveal the teacher's knowledge. In this paper, we propose a novel knowledge distillation framework for recommender system, called DE-RRD, which enables the student model to learn from the latent knowledge encoded in the teacher model as well as from the teacher's predictions. Concretely, DE-RRD consists of two methods: 1) Distillation Experts (DE) that directly transfers the latent knowledge from the teacher model. DE exploits ""experts"" and a novel expert selection strategy for effectively distilling the vast teacher's knowledge to the student with limited capacity. 2) Relaxed Ranking Distillation (RRD) that transfers the knowledge revealed from the teacher's prediction with consideration of the relaxed ranking orders among items. Our extensive experiments show that DE-RRD outperforms the state-of-the-art competitors and achieves comparable or even better performance to that of the teacher model with faster inference time.",30

","Interactive recommender system (IRS) has drawn huge attention because of its flexible recommendation strategy and the consideration of optimal long-term user experiences. To deal with the dynamic user preference and optimize accumulative utilities, researchers have introduced reinforcement learning (RL) into IRS. However, RL methods share a common issue of sample efficiency, i.e., huge amount of interaction data is required to train an effective recommendation policy, which is caused by the sparse user responses and the large action space consisting of a large number of candidate items. Moreover, it is infeasible to collect much data with explorative policies in online environments, which will probably harm user experience. In this work, we investigate the potential of leveraging knowledge graph (KG) in dealing with these issues of RL methods for IRS, which provides rich side information for recommendation decision making. Instead of learning RL policies from scratch, we make use of the prior knowledge of the item correlation learned from KG to (i) guide the candidate selection for better candidate item retrieval, (ii) enrich the representation of items and user states, and (iii) propagate user preferences among the correlated items over KG to deal with the sparsity of user feedback. Comprehensive experiments have been conducted on two real-world datasets, which demonstrate the superiority of our approach with significant improvements against state-of-the-arts.",6

First, it incorporates topic threads to enforce natural semantic transitions towards the recommendation scenario. Second, it is created in a semi-automatic way, hence human annotation is more reasonable and controllable.

","The general aim of the recommender system is to provide personalized suggestions to users, which is opposed to suggesting popular items. However, the normal training paradigm, i.e., fitting a recommender model to recover the user behavior data with pointwise or pairwise loss, makes the model biased towards popular items. This results in the terrible Matthew effect, making popular items be more frequently recommended and become even more popular. Existing work addresses this issue with Inverse Propensity Weighting (IPW), which decreases the impact of popular items on the training and increases the impact of long-tail items. Although theoretically sound, IPW methods are highly sensitive to the weighting strategy, which is notoriously difficult to tune. In this work, we explore the popularity bias issue from a novel and fundamental perspective --- cause-effect. We identify that popularity bias lies in the direct effect from the item node to the ranking score, such that an item's intrinsic property is the cause of mistakenly assigning it a higher ranking score. To eliminate popularity bias, it is essential to answer the counterfactual question that what the ranking score would be if the model only uses item property. To this end, we formulate a causal graph to describe the important cause-effect relations in the recommendation process. During training, we perform multi-task learning to achieve the contribution of each cause; during testing, we perform counterfactual inference to remove the effect of item popularity. Remarkably, our solution amends the learning process of recommendation which is agnostic to a wide range of models --- it can be easily implemented in existing methods. We demonstrate it on Matrix Factorization (MF) and LightGCN [20], which are representative of the conventional and SOTA model for collaborative filtering. Experiments on five real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.",12

","Deep recommender systems have achieved remarkable improvements in recent years. Despite its superior ranking precision, the running efficiency and memory consumption turn out to be severe bottlenecks in reality. To overcome both limitations, we propose LightRec, a lightweight recommender system which enjoys fast online inference and economic memory consumption. The backbone of LightRec is a total of B codebooks, each of which is composed of W latent vectors, known as codewords. On top of such a structure, LightRec will have an item represented as additive composition of B codewords, which are optimally selected from each of the codebooks. To effectively learn the codebooks from data, we devise an end-to-end learning workflow, where challenges on the inherent differentiability and diversity are conquered by the proposed techniques. In addition, to further improve the representation quality, several distillation strategies are employed, which better preserves user-item relevance scores and relative ranking orders. LightRec is extensively evaluated with four real-world datasets, which gives rise to two empirical findings: 1) compared with those the state-of-the-art lightweight baselines, LightRec achieves over 11% relative improvements in terms of recall performance; 2) compared to conventional recommendation algorithms, LightRec merely incurs negligible accuracy degradation while leads to more than 27x speedup in top-k recommendation.",25

","Practical recommender systems need be periodically retrained to refresh the model with new interaction data. To pursue high model fidelity, it is usually desirable to retrain the model on both historical and new data, since it can account for both long-term and short-term user preference. However, a full model retraining could be very time-consuming and memory-costly, especially when the scale of historical data is large. In this work, we study the model retraining mechanism for recommender systems, a topic of high practical values but has been relatively little explored in the research community. Our first belief is that retraining the model on historical data is unnecessary, since the model has been trained on it before. Nevertheless, normal training on new data only may easily cause overfitting and forgetting issues, since the new data is of a smaller scale and contains fewer information on long-term user preference. To address this dilemma, we propose a new training method, aiming to abandon the historical data during retraining through learning to transfer the past training experience.Specifically, we design a neural network-based transfer component, which transforms the old model to a new model that is tailored for future recommendations. To learn the transfer component well, we optimize the ""future performance'' -- i.e., the recommendation accuracy evaluated in the next time period. Our Sequential Meta-Learning(SML) method offers a general training paradigm that is applicable to any differentiable model. We demonstrate SML on matrix factorization and conduct experiments on two real-world datasets. Empirical results show that SML not only achieves significant speed-up, but also outperforms the full model retraining in recommendation accuracy, validating the effectiveness of our proposals.

","Depression is a leading cause of disability worldwide, which has inspired the design of mobile health (mHealth) applications for disease monitoring, prediction, and diagnosis. Less mHealth research has, however, focused on the treatment of depressive disorders. Clinical evidence shows that depressive symptoms can be reduced through a behavior change method known as Behavioral Activation (BA). This paper presents MUBS; a smartphone-based system for BA, which specifically contributes a personalized content-based activity recommendation model using a unique list of validated activities. An 8-week feasibility study with 17 depressive patients provided detailed insight into how MUBS provided inspiration and motivation for planning and engaging in more pleasant activities, thereby facilitating the core components of BA. Based on this study, the paper discusses how recommender technology can be used in the design of mHealth technology for BA.",7

","In many fields such as digital marketing, healthcare, finance, and robotics, it is common to have a well-tested and reliable baseline policy running in production (e.g., a recommender system). Nonetheless, the baseline policy is often suboptimal. In this case, it is desirable to deploy online learning algorithms (e.g., a multi-armed bandit algorithm) that interact with the system to learn a better/optimal policy under the constraint that during the learning process the performance is almost never worse than the performance of the baseline itself. In this paper, we study the conservative learning problem in the contextual linear bandit setting and introduce a novel algorithm, the Conservative Constrained LinUCB (CLUCB2). We derive regret bounds for CLUCB2 that match existing results and empirically show that it outperforms state-of-the-art conservative bandit algorithms in a number of synthetic and real-world problems. Finally, we consider a more realistic constraint where the performance is verified only at predefined checkpoints (instead of at every step) and show how this relaxed constraint favorably impacts the regret and empirical performance of CLUCB2.",47

","Recommender system (RS) has become a crucial module in most web-scale applications. Recently, most RSs are in the waterfall form based on the cloud-to-edge framework, where recommended results are transmitted to edge (e.g., user mobile) by computing in advance in the cloud server. Despite effectiveness, network bandwidth and latency between cloud server and edge may cause the delay for system feedback and user perception. Hence, real-time computing on edge could help capture user preferences more preciously and thus make more satisfactory recommendations. Our work, to our best knowledge, is the first attempt to design and implement the novel Recommender System on Edge (EdgeRec), which achieves Real-time User Perception and Real-time System Feedback. Moreover, we propose Heterogeneous User Behavior Sequence Modeling and Context-aware Reranking with Behavior Attention Networks to capture user's diverse interests and adjust recommendation results accordingly. Experimental results on both the offline evaluation and online performance in Taobao home-page feeds demonstrate the effectiveness of EdgeRec.",7

","Traditional recommender systems rely on user feedback such as ratings or clicks to the items, to analyze the user interest and provide personalized recommendations. However, rating or click feedback are limited in that they do not exactly tell why users like or dislike an item. If a user does not like the recommendations and can not effectively express the reasons via rating and clicking, the feedback from the user may be very sparse. These limitations lead to inefficient model learning of the recommender system. To address these limitations, more effective user feedback to the recommendations should be designed, so that the system can effectively understand a user's preference and improve the recommendations over time. In this paper, we propose a novel dialog-based recommender system to interactively recommend a list of items with visual appearance. At each time, the user receives a list of recommended items with visual appearance. The user can point to some items and describe their feedback, such as the desired features in the items they want in natural language. With this natural language based feedback, the recommender system updates and provides another list of items. To model the user behaviors of viewing, commenting and clicking on a list of items, we propose a visual dialog augmented cascade model. To efficiently understand the user preference and learn the model, exploration should be encouraged to provide more diverse recommendations to quickly collect user feedback on more attributes of the items. We propose a variant of the cascading bandits, where the neural representations of the item images and user feedback in natural language are utilized. In a task of recommending a list of footwear, we show that our visual dialog augmented interactive recommender needs around 41.03% rounds of recommendations, compared to the traditional interactive recommender only relying on the user click behavior.",7

","Capturing users' precise preferences is a fundamental problem in large-scale recommender system. Currently, item-based Collaborative Filtering (CF) methods are common matching approaches in industry. However, they are not effective to model dynamic and evolving preferences of users. In this paper, we propose a new sequential deep matching (SDM) model to capture users' dynamic preferences by combining short-term sessions and long-term behaviors. Compared with existing sequence-aware recommendation methods, we tackle the following two inherent problems in real-world applications: (1) there could exist multiple interest tendencies in one session. (2) long-term preferences may not be effectively fused with current session interests. Long-term behaviors are various and complex, hence those highly related to the short-term session should be kept for fusion. We propose to encode behavior sequences with two corresponding components: multi-head self-attention module to capture multiple types of interests and long-short term gated fusion module to incorporate long-term preferences. Successive items are recommended after matching between sequential user behavior vector and item embedding vectors. Offline experiments on real-world datasets show the superior performance of the proposed SDM. Moreover, SDM has been successfully deployed on online large-scale recommender system at Taobao and achieves improvements in terms of a range of commercial metrics.",32

","Recommender Systems (RSs) are widely used to help online users discover products, books, news, music, movies, courses, restaurants, etc. Because a traditional recommendation strategy always shows the most relevant items (thus with highest predicted rating), traditional RS’s are expected to make popular items become even more popular and non-popular items become even less popular which in turn further divides the haves (popular) from the have-nots (unpopular). Therefore, a major problem with RSs is that they may introduce biases affecting the exposure of items, thus creating a popularity divide of items during the feedback loop that occurs with users, and this may lead the RS to make increasingly biased recommendations over time. In this paper, we view the RS environment as a chain of events that are the result of interactions between users and the RS. Based on that, we propose several debiasing algorithms during this chain of events, and evaluate how these algorithms impact the predictive behavior of the RS, as well as trends in the popularity distribution of items over time. We also propose a novel blind-spot-aware matrix factorization (MF) algorithm to debias the RS. Results show that propensity matrix factorization achieved a certain level of debiasing of the RS while active learning combined with the propensity MF achieved a higher debiasing effect on recommendations.",13

In this paper, we reformulate the problem of usage pattern recommendation in terms of a collaborative-filtering recommender system. We present a new tool, FOCUS, which mines open-source project repositories to recommend API method invocations and usage patterns by analyzing how APIs are used in projects similar to the current project.

","Collaborative filtering is a broad and powerful framework for building recommendation systems that has seen widespread adoption. Over the past decade, the propensity of such systems for favoring popular products and thus creating echo chambers have been observed. This has given rise to an active area of research that seeks to diversify recommendations generated by such algorithms. We address the problem of increasing diversity in recom- mendation systems that are based on collaborative filtering that use past ratings to predict a rating quality for potential recommendations. Following our earlier work, we formulate recommendation system design as a subgraph selection problem from a candidate super-graph of potential recommendations where both diversity and rating quality are explicitly optimized: (1) On the modeling side, we define a new flexible notion of diversity that allows a system designer to prescribe the number of recommendations each item should receive, and smoothly penalizes deviations from this distribution. (2) On the algorithmic side, we show that minimum-cost network flow methods yield fast algorithms in theory and practice for designing recommendation subgraphs that optimize this notion of diversity. (3) On the empirical side, we show the effectiveness of our new model and method to increase diversity while maintaining high rating quality in standard rating data sets from Netflix and MovieLens.",19

To enhance the recommendation accuracy, we use two hybridization techniques: switching and weighted.

Due to this they face a serious setback in productivity. This problem of the farmers has been addressed through precision agriculture. Precision agriculture is a modern farming technique that uses research data of soil characteristics, soil types, crop yield data collection and suggests the farmers the right crop based on their site-specific parameters. This reduces the wrong choice on a crop and increase in productivity.

","Current learning management systems such as Moodle and WebCT are considered as linear systems that provide e-learning material in a fixed-sequence, delivering the same content to learners regardless of their differences in background knowledge. For learners engaged in self-study online distance learning, this may result in material being presented at either too high or too low cognitive levels. According to the Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD) theory, this may result in either frustration or boredom among learners. This paper proposes a recommender-system-based adaptive e-learning framework for personalised teaching on e-learning platforms. The framework would assist designers, teachers and learners to identify issues they need to consider in order to address challenges of poor engagement in online distance settings, arising from a “one-size-fits-all” approach that does not recognise the role of individual differences in teaching and learning. Secondly, the framework may enable the identification of problems or obstacles that may be encountered when supporting learners in their quest to reduce frustration and boredom when using a Recommender-Based Pedagogical System (RBPS). A literature review was conducted on adaptive e-learning systems based on the ZPD theory, learner modelling, the Generic Adaptive Framework and a recommendation system model. 70 articles were selected from a database of 720 articles published between 2010 and 2017 to come up with the dimensions needed to develop such a model for the framework through deductive analysis. The research found out that the majority of the studies only consider three dimensions to an adaptive framework, that is, the learner model, the content model and the adaptation engine while the Generic Adaptation Framework proposes seven dimensions. In addition, the majority of the studies are based on the principles of macro-adaptation which provide a “static” snapshot of a learner's profile instead of dynamically adjusting the adaptation as learner variables. In the proposed adaptive framework, we identified five dimensions, including real-time dynamic adaptation and context modelling in addition to the learner model, the domain model and the pedagogical strategy.",32

In this paper, we propose a simple yet promising algorithm. We fill the user-item matrix based on a low-rank assumption and simultaneously keep the original information. To do that, a nonconvex rank relaxation rather than the nuclear norm is adopted to provide a better rank approximation and an efficient optimization strategy is designed. A comprehensive set of experiments on real datasets demonstrates that our method pushes the accuracy of Top-N recommendation to a new level.

","More and more people are earing about the health and medical diagnosis problems. However, according to the administration's report, more than 200 thousand people in China, even 100 thousand in USA, die each year due to medication errors. More than 42% medication errors are caused by doctors because experts write the prescription according to their experiences which are quite limited. Technologies as data mining and recommender technologies provide possibilities to explore potential knowledge from diagnosis history records and help doctors to prescribe medication correctly to decrease medication error effectively. In this paper, we design and implement a universal medicine recommender system framework that applies data mining technologies to the recommendation system. The medicine recommender system consists of database system module, data preparation module, recommendation model module, model evaluation, and data visualization module. We investigate the medicine recommendation algorithms of the SVM (Support Vector Machine), BP neural network algorithm and ID3 decision tree algorithm based on the diagnosis data. Experiments are done to tune the parameters for each algorithm to get better performance. Finally, in the given open dataset, SVM recommendation model is selected for the medicine recommendation module to obtain a good trade-off among model accuracy, model efficiency, and model scalability. We also propose a mistake-check mechanism to ensure the diagnosis accuracy and service quality. Experimental results show our system can give medication recommendation with an excellent efficiency, accuracy and scalability.",7

","With the rapid development of location-based social networks (LBSNs), spatial item recommendation has become an important way of helping users discover interesting locations to increase their engagement with location-based services. Although human movement exhibits sequential patterns in LBSNs, most current studies on spatial item recommendations do not consider the sequential influence of locations. Leveraging sequential patterns in spatial item recommendation is, however, very challenging, considering 1) users' check-in data in LBSNs has a low sampling rate in both space and time, which renders existing prediction techniques on GPS trajectories ineffective; 2) the prediction space is extremely large, with millions of distinct locations as the next prediction target, which impedes the application of classical Markov chain models; and 3) there is no existing framework that unifies users' personal interests and the sequential influence in a principled manner. In light of the above challenges, we propose a sequential personalized spatial item recommendation framework (SPORE) which introduces a novel latent variable topic-region to model and fuse sequential influence with personal interests in the latent and exponential space. The advantages of modeling the sequential effect at the topic-region level include a significantly reduced prediction space, an effective alleviation of data sparsity and a direct expression of the semantic meaning of users' spatial activities. Furthermore, we design an asymmetric Locality Sensitive Hashing (ALSH) technique to speed up the online top-k recommendation process by extending the traditional LSH. We evaluate the performance of SPORE on two real datasets and one large-scale synthetic dataset. The results demonstrate a significant improvement in SPORE's ability to recommend spatial items, in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency, compared with the state-of-the-art methods.",7

This study utilizes UTAUT2 to explore the user acceptance of social recommender systems that have become more attractive owing to improved content personalization and adaptation to user preferences. Scholars have shown that these systems could improve a recommendation's accuracy. However, the UTAUT2's applicability and the explanation of performance expectancy for social recommender systems are still unclear. We developed a UTAUT2-based framework and tested it in a quantitative study with 266 participants. The structural equation model results show that UTAUT2 is applicable in the context of social recommender systems. Furthermore, the user's social network information, profile information, and reading behavior positively influence performance expectancy and the intention to adopt a social recommender system. Therefore, incorporating social information might overcome the shortcomings of other classic recommender systems.",19

","Social network studies are becoming increasingly popular and have been applied to several fields of study such as law enforcement, marketing, spread of disease, as well as in the improvement of organizational performance. One area that is yet to be explored relates to harnessing the power of social networks as recommender systems. The idea that users may provide other users with recommendations that are more relevant than naive approaches is long known. However, the approaches currently implemented are based on the creation of simple relationships such as co-purchase of similar items. Similarly, video websites would like to suggest related videos to users to maximize the time they spend on their sites. Ergo it is crucial that sites like YouTube provide users with recommendations that are relevant to them. Moreover, given the large amount of videos on YouTube, a good recommender system may alleviate users' efforts on finding videos that interest them the most. Existing recommender systems for YouTube are typically based on finding similarities between the videos' textual features (video title or tags annotations) and matching these features to tags in the user's profiles or the videos they are currently watching. This approach is very limited because it restricts the users interests to the current theme of the video being played or the preferences in their profiles. This means that if one is watching a movie about football, it is assumed that the user would like recommendations on other videos about football. In this paper, we attempt to extract information about video relationship using a network formed from reviews left as comments in YouTube videos. We create a network of videos called YouTube Recommender Network (YRN) and use complex network analysis on this network as the basis of a recommender system. Our results show that our list of recommended videos is more diverse than the ones based on textual information. Our YRN provides diversity and captures other important characteristics such as high rating and most-viewed count.",31

","PROBLEM
Future physicians will practice medicine in an increasingly complex health care system. To become effective leaders of value-based teams and to practice cost-conscious care, medical students need training in and exposure to value conscious medicine (VCM).


APPROACH
A student-led initiative to enhance education in VCM led to the development of the 4-week elective course (High Value Care: in Policy and in Practice) for postclerkship third- and fourth-year students, introduced in 2021 at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. The course included structured didactics, self-directed online modules, a book club, and flipped-classroom discussions in addition to clinical rotations focused on VCM in practice.


OUTCOMES
Students' self-ratings of their understanding of VCM, preparation to practice value-based care, and comfort incorporating patient and system costs into clinical decisions improved after completing the course. Most indicated they would recommend the course to their peers. Suggestions for improvement included more teach-back sessions with faculty as well as more direction for preceptors to demonstrate specific aspects of VCM.


NEXT STEPS
The authors share this example of a dedicated medical school VCM course as a step toward achieving the vision of integrating value into clinical decision-making and empowering students to become informed and capable future physicians. Other institutions may consider adapting this course example to prepare their students to practice VCM in an increasingly cost-focused system.",47

","Recommender systems are technology-driven marketing solutions for businesses that analyze user behavior data. However, collaborative data sharing between enterprises is often prohibited by privacy protection regulations, leading to insufficient data for graph neural networks (GNNs) training. Fortunately, federated learning (FL), a collaborative training framework without exposing source data, can be applied congruently. Nevertheless, most of FL-based GNN model training methods adopt federated averaging, which performs poorly on highly heterogeneous graph data. To solve this problem, a FL-based GNN Model Training framework for cross-enterprise recommendation, named FL-GMT, is proposed. Specifically, a GNN-based recommendation model is deployed as the local training model. Then, considering the performance inequity caused by uneven sample quality, a loss-based federated aggregation algorithm is designed, effectively improving the performance of disadvantaged participants. To improve the system stability at the end of the aggregation, a dynamic update method of loss attention is designed. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that FL-GMT outperforms baselines in terms of system fairness, stability, and accuracy.",43

In this work, we propose a new ensemble recommendation system that combines different context information (customer-product interaction, item characteristics and user behaviour) with the predictions (recommendations) of different state-of-the-art traditional Recommender Systems to recognize new patterns in user-item interaction and to ensure a desirable level of personalization for fashion domains. Specifically, in the present work, we present a first instantiation that combines a collaborative filtering neural network method, a non-customized classical method and domain context information.

","Africa accounts for nearly half of all deaths resulting from communicable diseases globally. A deteriorating health system can be attributed to these deaths. Unfortunately, most African countries have some of the weakest health systems. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that strong health systems are critical for the improvement of health outcomes and for accelerating progress towards the achievement of Universal Health Coverage (UHC) and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) related to health. This has led to the rise of health system strengthening as a political agenda for countries in the WHO African Region. At a time when countries in this region are facing an economic downturn, the novel coronavirus, “severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2)” adds to the challenges faced in health system strengthening. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has revealed major weaknesses in health systems globally, presenting a major threat to the already fragile health systems in Africa, revealing the urgent need for stronger health systems in Africa. In this paper, we present an updated literature review of the pertinent gaps in Africa’s health systems and synthesized the findings by utilizing the six basic building blocks of health system strengthening (health workforce, access to equipment and essential medicines, service delivery, health information systems, leadership & governance) and other related aspects (health policy, health research, health monitoring and evaluation and disaster preparedness) in the context of COVID-19. Finally, the paper identifies priority strategies for health system strengthening in Africa.",28

","Background: Gastric cancer remains one of the leading causes of worldwide cancer-specific deaths. Accurately predicting the survival likelihood of gastric cancer patients can inform caregivers to boost patient prognostication and choose the best possible treatment path. This study intends to develop an intelligent system based on machine learning (ML) algorithms for predicting the 5-year survival status in gastric cancer patients. Methods: A data set that includes the records of 974 gastric cancer patients retrospectively was used. First, the most important predictors were recognized using the Boruta feature selection algorithm. Five classifiers, including J48 decision tree (DT), support vector machine (SVM) with radial basic function (RBF) kernel, bootstrap aggregating (Bagging), hist gradient boosting (HGB), and adaptive boosting (AdaBoost), were trained for predicting gastric cancer survival. The performance of the used techniques was evaluated with specificity, sensitivity, likelihood ratio, and total accuracy. Finally, the system was developed according to the best model. Results: The stage, position, and size of tumor were selected as the 3 top predictors for gastric cancer survival. Among the 6 selected ML algorithms, the HGB classifier with the mean accuracy, mean specificity, mean sensitivity, mean area under the curve, and mean F1-score of 88.37%, 86.24%, 89.72%, 88.11%, and 89.91%, respectively, gained the best performance. Conclusions: The ML models can accurately predict the 5-year survival and potentially act as a customized recommender for decision-making in gastric cancer patients. The developed system in our study can improve the quality of treatment, patient safety, and survival rates; it may guide prescribing more personalized medicine.",2

","Background: To explore the feasibility and effectiveness of multifaceted quality improvement intervention based on the clinical decision support system (CDSS) in VTE prophylaxis in hospitalized patients. Methods: A randomized, department-based clinical trial was conducted in the department of respiratory and critical care medicine, orthopedic, and general surgery wards. Patients aged ≥18 years, without VTE in admission, were allocated to the intervention group and received regular care combined with multifaceted quality improvement intervention based on CDSS during hospitalization. VTE prophylaxis rate and the occurrence of hospital-associated VTE events were analyzed as primary and secondary outcomes. Results: A total of 3644 eligible residents were enrolled in this trial. With the implementation of the multifaceted quality improvement intervention based on the CDSS, the VTE prophylaxis rate of the intervention group increased from 22.93% to 34.56% (p < 0.001), and the incidence of HA-VTE events increased from 0.49% to 1.00% (p = 0.366). In the nonintervention group, the VTE prophylaxis rate increased from 24.49% to 27.90% (p = 0.091), and the incidence of HA-VTE events increased from 0.47% to 2.02% (p = 0.001). Conclusions: Multifaceted quality improvement intervention based on the CDSS strategy is feasible and expected to facilitate implementation of the recommended VTE prophylaxis strategies and reduce the incidence of HA-VTE in hospital. However, it is necessary to conduct more multicenter clinical trials in the future to provide more reliable real-world evidence.",44

","Recommender Systems (RSs) are considered as popular tools that have revolutionized the e-commerce and digital marketing. Their main goal is predicting the users’ future preferences and providing accessible and personalized recommendations. However, uncertainty can spread at any level throughout the recommendation process, which may affect the results. In fact, the ratings given by the users are often unreliable. The final provided predictions itself may also be pervaded with uncertainty and doubt. Obviously, the reliability of the predictions cannot be fully certain and trustworthy. For the system to be effective, recommendations must inspire trust in the system and provide reliable and credible recommendations. The user may speculate about the uncertainty pervaded behind the given recommendation. He could tend to a reliable recommendation offering him a global overview about his preferences rather than an inappropriate one that contradicts his activities and objectives. While such imperfection cannot be ignored, traditional RSs are rarely able to deal with the uncertainty spreading around the prediction process, which may affect the credibility, the transparency and the trustworthiness of the current RS. Thus, in this paper, we opt for the uncertain framework of the belief function theory (BFT), which allows us to represent, quantify and manage imperfect evidence. By using the BFT, the users’ preferences and the interactions between the neighbors can be represented under uncertainty. Evidence from different information sources can then be combined leading to more reliable results. The proposed approach is a hybrid evidential movie RS that uses different data sources and delivers a personalized user-interface allowing a global overview of the possible future preferences. This representation would increase the users’ confidence towards the system as well as their satisfaction. Experiments are performed on MovieLens and their additional features provided by the Internet Movie Database (IMDb) and Rotten Tomatoes. The new approach achieves promising results compared to traditional approaches in terms of MAE, NMAE and RMSE. It also reaches interesting Precision, Recall and F-measure values of respectively, 0.782, 0.792 and 0.787.",25

They immediately achieved state-of-the-art in image synthesis, image-to-image translation, text-to-image generation, image inpainting and have been used in sciences ranging from medicine to high-energy particle physics. Despite their popularity and ability to learn arbitrary distributions, GAN have not been widely applied in recommender systems (RS). Moreover, only few of the techniques that have introduced GAN in RS have employed them directly as a collaborative filtering (CF) model. In this work we propose a new GAN-based approach that learns user and item latent factors in a matrix factorization setting for the generic top-N recommendation problem. Following the vector-wise GAN training approach for RS introduced by CFGAN, we identify 2 unique issues when utilizing GAN for CF. We propose solutions for both of them by using an autoencoder as discriminator and incorporating an additional loss function for the generator. We evaluate our model, GANMF, through well-known datasets in the RS community and show improvements over traditional CF approaches and GAN-based models. Through an ablation study on the components of GANMF we aim to understand the effects of our architectural choices.

","Precision medicine is a new approach to understanding health and disease based on patient-specific data such as medical diagnoses; clinical phenotype; biologic investigations such as laboratory studies and imaging; and environmental, demographic, and lifestyle factors. The importance of machine learning techniques in healthcare has expanded quickly in the last decade owing to the rising availability of vast multi-modality data and developed computational models and algorithms. Reinforcement learning is an appealing method for developing efficient policies in various healthcare areas where the decision-making process is typically defined by a long period or a sequential process. In our research, we leverage the power of reinforcement learning and electronic health records of South Koreans to dynamically recommend treatment prescriptions, which are personalized based on patient information of hypertension. Our proposed reinforcement learning-based treatment recommendation system decides whether to use mono, dual, or triple therapy according to the state of the hypertension patients. We evaluated the performance of our personalized treatment recommendation model by lowering the occurrence of hypertension-related complications and blood pressure levels of patients who followed our model’s recommendation. With our findings, we believe that our proposed hypertension treatment recommendation model could assist doctors in prescribing appropriate antihypertensive medications.",6

The efficacy of Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) for PSD has also received widespread attention, but there is still a lack of clinical evidence because this overview evaluates the published meta-analyses (MAs)/Systematic reviews (SRs). To provide evidence for the clinical application of CHM in the treatment of PSD Methods: Two researchers searched 7 databases for SRs/MAs which are about randomized controlled trials on CHM for PSD. Two investigators use the systematic review assessment tool (AMSTAR-2), the risk of bias in systematic scale, the list of preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis, and the classification of recommended assessments for evaluation, development and evaluation system to assess the included SRs/MAs. Results: Our findings will be published in peer-reviewed journals. Conclusion: This study provides evidence-based medical evidence for the impact of CHM on PSD.

","In precision medicine, the ultimate goal is to recommend the most effective treatment to an individual patient based on patient‐specific molecular and clinical profiles, possibly high‐dimensional. To advance cancer treatment, large‐scale screenings of cancer cell lines against chemical compounds have been performed to help better understand the relationship between genomic features and drug response; existing machine learning approaches use exclusively supervised learning, including penalized regression and recommender systems. However, it would be more efficient to apply reinforcement learning to sequentially learn as data accrue, including selecting the most promising therapy for a patient given individual molecular and clinical features and then collecting and learning from the corresponding data. In this article, we propose a novel personalized ranking system called Proximal Policy Optimization Ranking (PPORank), which ranks the drugs based on their predicted effects per cell line (or patient) in the framework of deep reinforcement learning (DRL). Modeled as a Markov decision process, the proposed method learns to recommend the most suitable drugs sequentially and continuously over time. As a proof‐of‐concept, we conduct experiments on two large‐scale cancer cell line data sets in addition to simulated data. The results demonstrate that the proposed DRL‐based PPORank outperforms the state‐of‐the‐art competitors based on supervised learning. Taken together, we conclude that novel methods in the framework of DRL have great potential for precision medicine and should be further studied.",18

","The importance of online recommender systems for drugs, medical professionals, and hospitals is growing. Today, the majority of people use online consultations for drug recommendations for all types of health issues. Emergencies such as pandemics, floods, or cyclones can be helped by the medical recommender system. In the era of machine learning (ML), recommender systems produce more accurate, quick, and reliable clinical predictions with minimal costs. As a result, these systems maintain better performance, integrity, and privacy of patient data in the decision-making process and provide precise information at any time. Therefore, we present drug recommender systems with a stacked artificial neural network (ANN) model to improve the fairness and safety of treatment for infectious diseases. To reduce side effects, drugs are recommended based on a patient’s previous health profile, lifestyle, and habits. The proposed system produced results with 97.5% accuracy. A system such as this could be useful in recommending safe medicines to patients, especially during health emergencies.",9

","In the first 3 decades of the 20th century, John D. Rockefeller Sr. and Andrew Carnegie used their philanthropy to support 2 main mechanisms that functioned to exclude African American doctors from medical education and the medical profession. First, Carnegie funded the Flexner report, recommending reforms to medical education including the closure of most Black medical schools. Next, Rockefeller’s General Education Board (GEB) funded restructures to medical education without equal support to ensure Black medical schools could keep up with changing standards. For every dollar the GEB donated to Black medical schools between 1902 and 1919, it donated $123 to White schools. During that period, for every dollar the GEB donated to White medical schools per White resident, it donated about $0.07 to Black schools per African American resident. Next, Rockefeller’s philanthropy supported a system of school education that underprepared African American candidates to meet the requirements needed to enter medicine. For African American children, the GEB supported a kind of schooling termed industrial education, which emphasized manual training (e.g., skills related to agricultural science and efficiency). In 1933, industrial education schools were located in 57% of all Southern counties, and two-thirds of African Americans who attended primary and secondary school received an education that followed the industrial education curriculum. Industrial education underprepared candidates for applying to medical school, completing a medical school curriculum, and passing a medical board examination. This article examines how these 2 mechanisms had lasting and harmful effects on the underrepresentation of African American doctors in the medical workforce. These insights provide a broad and collective understanding of the early role of philanthropy in excluding African Americans from the medical profession, which is a crucial first step toward developing interventions to help redress racial discrepancies in the medical profession that persist today.",35

","Abstract An ever-increasing number of individuals hear about the well-being and clinical determination issues. Nonetheless, as indicated by the organization’s report, over 200 thousand individuals in China, even 100 thousand in the USA, bite the dust every year due to prescription mistakes. Specialists makeovers 42% of medicine mistakes since they compose the remedy as indicated by their very restricted encounters. Advancements such as information mining and recommender innovations provide prospects to investigate likely information from determination history records and assist specialists with endorsing drugs accurately to diminish prescription mistakes adequately. This paper plans and actualizes a general medication recommender system that applies information mining to suggest a better prescription to hospitalized patients. Our medication recommender system consists of constructing feature modules, data splitting modules, count vectorizers, and sentiment classification modules. The classifiers such as logistic regression, Naive Bayes, and random forest are used for the model evaluation. Our classification results show that the random forest-based medication recommender system has the highest prediction results than other classifiers.

","Coughs are one of the most frequent reasons for visiting a physician during childhood. They disrupt sleep, are uncomfortable and cause anxiety for both children and their parents. It is widely accepted that cough medicines should not be prescribed, or recommended, for children. We previously published data on cough medicine prescriptions before and after the 2014 Finnish Current Care Guidelines on children's lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) were published. These guidelines advice not to prescribe cough medicines to children. The data were collected from three public and two private outpatient clinics. They comprised 153 prescriptions for cough medicines, issued during 1661 visits for children's LRTIs1 in November and December 2012 and 2013 and the same months in 2014 and 2015. This showed that the guidelines had no immediate impact on cough medicine prescriptions.1 We then designed a systematic intervention to reduce prescriptions for cough medicines, which is described in more detail below. It significantly reduced cough medicine prescriptions issued in 2017– 2020 by Terveystalo, the largest private health care service company in Finland, which receives 260,000 paediatric visits per year.2 This study built on those studies,1,2 by evaluating cough medicine prescriptions with LRTIs issued to children aged 0– 15 years by two private outpatient clinics run by Terveystalo from 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2020. These clinics, in Tampere in SouthWest Finland and Kouvola in SouthEast Finland, also took part in the previous studies.1,2 This enabled us to evaluate the impact of the 2014 guidelines1 and whether the active intervention in 2017– 20202 provided greater momentum for eradicating cough medicine prescriptions especially for children with LRTIs. Terveystalo's electronic health record system enabled us to carry out a followup study based on realtime data about specific physicians. The 2017– 2020 intervention aimed to eradicate cough medicine prescriptions for children, by sending educational material to physicians and caregivers. These were based on the Finnish guidelines, which do not recommend cough medicines for children. General reminders were sent to physicians who had prescribed cough medicines and they were sent personalised letters, followed up by phone calls, if they continued prescribing. Data on cases were gathered from the electronic health records using the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision codes that included a cough as a symptom (J11*, J18*, J20*, J21* and J22*). Drug prescriptions were identified using the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification system codes R05F (combined cough suppressants and expectorants), R05C (just cough expectorants) and R05D (just cough suppressants). Drug prescriptions were linked to the prescribing physicians and clinics, to allow targeted interventions.2 We estimated the medication costs using the 2021 price for each product in Euros, multiplied by the number of prescriptions per clinic per year, as Finnish pharmacies charge patients the same price for medication.2 We assumed that every prescribed cough medicine was purchased. The analyses included all children aged 0– 15 years with LRTIs who visited the two private outpatient clinics from 2014 to 2020. SPSS Statistics for Windows, version 26 (IBM Corp), was used for the data analysis. There were 13,444 visits for paediatric LRTIs to the two clinics during 2014– 2020: 24.5% at <2 years of age, 27.6% at 2– 4 years, 32.1% at 5– 11 years and 15.8% at 12– 15 years. We found that 59.8% were treated by general practitioners, 17.9% by paediatricians and 6.4% by ear, nose and throat doctors. The other 15.9% were treated by other specialists. In 2016, before the active intervention, 68/1169 (5.8%) and 234/1469 (15.9%) of the children received cough medicine prescriptions for LRTIs from the Pirkanmaa and Kymenlaakso clinics, respectively (Figure 1). The annual costs paid by families were €2136 and €5388, respectively. No cough medicine prescriptions were issued by the Pirkanmaa clinic in 2020. The Kymenlaakso clinic did not issue any prescriptions for children under 2 years, but did issue prescriptions for 4/278 (1.4%) older children. The annual costs decreased to €0 and €89, respectively. This study of these two private outpatient clinics confirmed the results of the nationwide intervention study.2 The numbers of",35

","Objectives The aim of this study was to evaluate upper and lower urinary tract complications and the compliance of long-term treatment in patients with spinal cord injury (SCI) by urodynamic examination. Patients and methods Between January 1997 and May 2007, a total of 89 patients with SCI (79 males, 19 females; mean age: 39.8±12.2 years; range, 19 to 72 years) who were admitted to physical medicine and rehabilitation clinic were retrospectively analyzed. Demographic, neurological, and urodynamic data of the patients with the diagnosis of neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction (NLUTD) in their initial urodynamic examination and without regular follow-up were recorded. Results The mean time to the first urodynamic examination was 8.6±5.4 months. Sixty-seven patients who had neurogenic detrusor overactivity (NDO) in their first urodynamic tests were recommended anticholinergics. Clean intermittent catheterization (CIC) was recommended after initial urodynamic examination in all patients. Thirty-nine patients of 67 who had NDO were taking medications, while 28 were not. In the patients who continued anticholinergic treatment, bladder capacity was found to statistically significantly increase, compared to the initial measurement values and detrusor pressures significantly decreased (p<0.001). The compliance rate with CIC and anticholinergic treatment was 79.8% and 58.2%, respectively. Sixteen of the patients had calculus in the urinary system. Forty-two patients had infections more than once a year and used antibiotics. Conclusion Neurogenic bladder should be evaluated at the beginning of SCI and, then, followed on a regular basis. Urodynamic tests should be performed immediately after spinal shock and can be repeated, as indicated.",26

","Traumatic brain injury (TBI) takes a substantial toll on health and health care costs in the US. Yet TBI is often unrecognized, misclassified, undertreated (especially in its longer-term manifestations), and, in proportion to its public health consequences, underresearched. Despite the dedication of an increasing number of professionals, disciplines,andorganizationsdevotedtoTBIcareandresearch, includinginnovativeprogramsformilitaryservicemembers and veterans, care often fails to meet the needs of affected individuals, families, and communities. The US lacks consolidatedleadershipforachievingimprovementsinTBIcare andoutcomes,and,partlyasaresult, it lacksastrategicplan for fostering change and overseeing progress. With stronger leadership and proper redesign, the health care system could reduce the morbidity and disability associated with TBI, while enhancing the effectiveness of TBI care. These are among the conclusions of a National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine report, Traumatic Brain Injury: A Roadmap for Accelerating Progress,1 written by an 18-member committee, which met over 15 months from 2020 to 2022, gathered testimony from more than 50 researchers, practitioners, patients, and families who experienced TBI and its sequelae, and analyzed evidence from peer-reviewed publications. While the report acknowledges the importance of prevention, its focus is on postinjury care. TBI encompasses injuries of vastly different severity and causation ranging from concussions during sports participation, to head trauma from falls in older adults, to skull fracturesfromautomobilecrashes,topenetratingwounds from projectiles and military combat, and to many other causes of neurotrauma. A consolidated registry is lacking, but data from 2009 and 2010 suggested that an estimated 4.8 million people were evaluated for TBI in US emergency departments each year, and data from 2013 suggested that TBI was diagnosed in approximately 2% of total emergency visits, hospitalizations, and deaths in the US.2,3 In 2017, TBI contributed to an estimated 224 000 hospitalizations and 61 000 deaths, and 2.5 million high school students reported having experienced at least 1 concussion.4,5 Worldwide, more than 55 million people are estimated to experience a “mild” TBI and 5.5 million are estimated to experience a “severe” TBI each year.6 TBI is more than an acute event. Although many individuals who experience a so-called mild TBI, such as a concussion, recover in weeks, others report ongoing symptoms for much longer.7 Many people who experience severe TBI are challenged with chronic, or even lifetime, morbidity and disability. The consequent physical and psychological effects and the economic costs for patients, families, and communities are high. An estimated 2.5 million caregivers in the US are supporting a family member with TBI.8 Lifetime financial costs in health care, lost income, and reduced quality of life are difficult to measure but have been estimated to be as high as $750 billion for the estimated 2 million people who experience TBI in the US each year.9 Despite its magnitude as a public health problem, TBI continues to be misunderstood and not optimally managed. Not all brain insults are identified or reported as such at the time of injury or during acute triage. The public, and many clinicians, may not realize that even the “mildest” TBIs can have downstream effects and could benefit from follow-up care, timely rehabilitation, and social and psychological support. TBI follow-up is often inadequate. Individuals with mild TBI may not receive a referral for follow-up or have no contact with a clinician after hospital discharge, even when they experience symptoms, and clinicians and patients may fail to realize that subsequent symptoms are connected to a prior TBI. Even when impairments from injury are evident, one estimate from 2012 suggested that only 13% to 25% of people with moderate, severe, or penetrating TBI received interdisciplinary inpatient rehabilitation.10 During its public workshops, the committee heard painful testimony from patients and families who, although grateful for superb acute care, felt lost and abandoned by the health care system in the months and years that followed, as they tried to cope with significant physical and psychological sequelae. Part of the problem of underrecognition and undertreatment is that categorization of TBI as “mild,” “moderate,” and “severe” does not reflect the state of scientific knowledge. Injuries labeled as mild can have downstream morbidity, while severe cases may sometimes achieve levels of recovery that violate conventional wisdom. A more evidence-basedapproach,combiningclinicalpresentation and the time-honored Glasgow Coma Scale score with advances in biomarkers and imaging, is needed to improve assessment, inform triage, and bolster treatment guidelines. By way of analogy, the report observes, “Today, one couldnotimagineclassifyingcanceras‘mild,moderate,and severe’ for diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis.”1 Rather than viewing TBI as an acute physiological event, the report proposes a “bio-psychosocioecological” model, using multiple lenses through which to appreciate the needs and condition of people living with TBI.Thatmodelhighlightstheimportanceofasystem-wide health care approach able to anticipate and respond to needs in a coordinated fashion, with regular reassessment of care plans. It also emphasizes the importance of a focus on racial and socioeconomic equity. The report further recommends that the National Academies’ specifications for a “learning health care system” be applied to the approach to TBI care nationally, regionally, and locally. That requires VIEWPOINT",26

","Recommender systems (RS) mediate human experience online. Most RS act to optimize metrics that are imperfectly aligned with the best-interest of users but are easy to measure, like ad-clicks and user engagement. This has resulted in a host of hard-to-measure side-effects: political polarisation [1], addiction [2] [3], fake news [4]. RS design faces a recommender alignment problem: that of aligning recommendations with the goals of users, system designers, and society as a whole. But how do we test and compare potential solutions to align RS? Their massive scale makes them costly and risky to test in deployment. We synthesized a simple abstract modelling framework to guide future work. To illustrate it, we construct a toy experiment where we ask: ""How can we evaluate the consequences of using user retention as a reward function?"" To answer the question, we learn recommender policies that optimize reward functions by controlling graph dynamics on a toy environment. Based on the effects that trained recommenders have on their environment, we conclude that engagement maximizers generally lead to worse outcomes than aligned recommenders but not always. After learning, we examine competition between RS as a potential solution to RS alignment. We find that it generally makes our toy-society better-off than it would be under the absence of recommendation or engagement maximizers. In this work, we aimed for a broad scope, touching superficially on many different points to shed light on how an end-to-end study of reward functions for recommender systems might be done. Recommender alignment is a pressing and important problem. Attempted solutions are sure to have far-reaching impacts. Here, we take a first step in developing methods to evaluating and comparing solutions with respect to their impacts on society.",7

","The Penn Medicine BioBank (PMBB) is an electronic health record (EHR)-linked biobank at the University of Pennsylvania (Penn Medicine). A large variety of health-related information, ranging from diagnosis codes to laboratory measurements, imaging data and lifestyle information, is integrated with genomic and biomarker data in the PMBB to facilitate discoveries and translational science. To date, 174,712 participants have been enrolled into the PMBB, including approximately 30% of participants of non-European ancestry, making it one of the most diverse medical biobanks. There is a median of seven years of longitudinal data in the EHR available on participants, who also consent to permission to recontact. Herein, we describe the operations and infrastructure of the PMBB, summarize the phenotypic architecture of the enrolled participants, and use body mass index (BMI) as a proof-of-concept quantitative phenotype for PheWAS, LabWAS, and GWAS. The major representation of African-American participants in the PMBB addresses the essential need to expand the diversity in genetic and translational research. There is a critical need for a “medical biobank consortium” to facilitate replication, increase power for rare phenotypes and variants, and promote harmonized collaboration to optimize the potential for biological discovery and precision medicine.",17

","Vaccine hesitancy (VH) is one of the main causes of the widespread decline in vaccination coverage and has become the subject of ongoing debate among public health professionals. The present commentary is a “decalogue” of strategic actions to counteract vaccine hesitancy for public health professionals that comes from the cognitive and formative path put in place by the “Communication in Public Health” working group (WG) of the Italian Society of Hygiene, Preventive Medicine, and Public Health. From the establishment of a national, multidisciplinary WG on VH to the activation of a national monitoring/surveillance system on vaccine hesitancy, several proposals are discussed. The identification and dissemination of good practices and tools to counteract and understand vaccine hesitancy, interdisciplinary training on vaccine hesitancy and on risk communication, community engagement and infodemiology, the inclusion of effective interventions to counteract vaccine hesitancy within the National Immunization Plan (NIP), the promotion and growth of a community of practice and research in the field of vaccine hesitancy, collaborations between scientific societies, and knowledge from the behavioral sciences represent other actions recommended in the present commentary. The present document suggests ten undeferrable strategies that could be implemented at the national and local levels in Italy, and that could be borrowed by other European countries in order to counteract vaccines hesitancy with a systematic and organic approach.",28

","A recommender system is an information selection system that offers preferences to users and enhances their decision-making. This system is commonly implemented in human-computer-interaction (HCI) intervention because of its information filtering and personalization. However, its success rate in decision-making intervention is considered low and the rationale for this is associated with users’ psychological reactance which is causing unsuccessful recommender system interventions. This paper employs a computational model to depict factors that lead to recommender system rejection by users and how these factors can be enhanced to achieve successful recommender system interventions. The study made use of design science research methodology by executing a computational analysis based on an agent-based simulation approach for the model development and implementation. A total of sixteen model concepts were identified and formalized which were implemented in a Matlab environment using three major case conditions as suggested in previous studies. The result of the study provides an explicit comprehension on interplaying of recommender system that generate psychological reactance which is of great importance to recommender system developers and designers to depict how successful recommender system interventions can be achieved without users experiencing reactance and rejection on the system.",7

","Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common disease that is often under-diagnosed and under-treated in all ages. This is due to differences in morphology, diversity in clinical phenotypes, and differences in diagnosis and treatment of OSA in children and adults, even among individuals of the same age. Therefore, a personalized medicine approach to diagnosis and treatment of OSA is necessary for physicians in clinical practice. In children and adults without serious underlying medical conditions, polysomnography at sleep labs may be an inappropriate and inconvenient testing modality compared to home sleep apnea testing. In addition, the apnea–hypopnea index should not be considered as a single parameter for making treatment decisions. Thus, the treatment of OSA should be personalized and based on individual tolerance to sleep-quality-related parameters measured by the microarousal index, harmful effects of OSA on the cardiovascular system related to severe hypoxia, and patients’ comorbidities. The current treatment options for OSA include lifestyle modification, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy, oral appliance, surgery, and other alternative treatments. CPAP therapy has been recommended as a cornerstone treatment for moderate-to-severe OSA in adults. However, not all patients can afford or tolerate CPAP therapy. This narrative review seeks to describe the current concepts and relevant approaches towards personalized management of patients with OSA, according to pathophysiology, cluster analysis of clinical characteristics, adequate combined therapy, and the consideration of patients’ expectations.",54

With the global death toll nearing 3.3 million, India being amongst the top 4 countries, the condition is more than fearsome. World Health Organization (WHO) recommends one doctor per 1000 population ratio, but India lags it by one doctor to 1456 people, which sets a lot of pressure on the healthcare system. Traditional remedies are becoming increasingly popular in India as a result of the lack of a proper medical system. Due to the rich diversity of medicinal herbs and drugs; India has been managing health issues with its 5000 years old medication system. Amidst all this, the traditional medicine system has given relief to plenty of diseases and remains the primary defence system against COVID-19. Therefore, COVID-19 is also managed by its different medicinal systems, which are collectively known as the AYUSH regime. It had been a recognized system to tackle diseases in the past. In this mini-review, we performed a deep study of the Indian traditional medicine system in managing the COVID-19 situation.

","Abstract Access to affordable, safe, effective, and quality-assured medicines by a patient is important for good health outcomes. Unfortunately, there is sparse literature published on the pharmaceutical enablers that may increase the sale of a substandard and falsified (SF) medicine to a patient in Kenya. The review highlights some of the factors that may facilitate the entry of SF medicines into the legitimate pharmaceutical supply chain and discusses their impact on patient access to medicines. Lack of essential medicines in public health facilities is an important factor that may contribute to increased demand for medicine-related out-of-pocket expenses from private health facilities, thus a likelihood for a patient purchasing SF medicine from unlicensed and illegal medicine outlets or unregulated websites. The need to increase medicine availability in the public sector by the Ministry of Health (MOH) is emphasized in addition to the strengthening of public procurement to cushion it from corruption and mismanagement. In addition, the MOH should promote local pharmaceutical manufacturing and implement a medicine pricing containment policy to avoid abuse and prevent overexploitation of patients, increase medicine price transparency, and reduce pharmaceutical supply chain distortion. Recommended regulatory reviews include accreditation of unlicensed illegal medicine outlets to facilitate accountability, regulatory oversight, and active surveillance. The national post-market surveillance regulatory capacity should be strengthened to improve rational medicine use. A 3-year diploma course should be replaced with a shorter 1- or 2-year pharmaceutical support staff training not eligible to superintend a pharmacy. The recommended legislative review includes a mandatory clause to enforce generic prescribing and the implementation of generic substitution by health workers. Unethical manipulative pharmaceutical marketing practices should carry stiffer penalties to deter malpractice. Future research areas include investigation of medicine prescribing and dispensing practices, medicine consumption studies, medicine price differences within different health sub-sectors, and between licensed pharmacies and unlicensed illegal medicine outlets.",17

","Background The rate of severity is a critical factor affecting the prognosis and mortality in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Lianhua Qingwen capsules or granules (LQ) have been a promising Chinese patent medicine in treating infectious diseases and recommended for treating COVID-19. This meta-analysis aims to demonstrate the association between LQ treatment and the rate of severity in patients with mild or moderate COVID-19. Methods 7 electronic databases were systematically searched from the inception dates to March 27, 2021, using the search terms to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Two reviewers independently identified studies, extracted the data, and assessed study quality. All analyses were conducted on RevMan 5.3 software. Results A total of 5 RCTs involving 830 patients with mild or moderate COVID-19 were identified according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The quality of included studies is moderate. Compared with conventional therapy, there was a significant association of LQ treatment with a higher clinical efficacy (RR = 1.24, 95% CI (1.13, 1.36), P < 0.00001), rate of CT improvement (RR = 1.22, 95% CI (1.10, 1.34), P=0.0001), and a lower rate of conversion to severe cases (RR = 0.47, 95%CI (0.31, 0.71), P=0.0003). Conclusion LQ combined with conventional therapy had great effects in reducing the rate of severity, and these findings supported the routine treatment of LQ in patients with mild or moderate COVID-19.",17

","Abstract Objectives Internal quality control (IQC) plays an important role in quality assurance in laboratory medicine. However, there is no universal consensus or guideline on when and how IQC should be analyzed on point-of-care testing (POCT) devices. The aim of this study was to develop a scoring system to determine how often IQC should be analyzed in primary healthcare on the various POCT devices. Methods Based on a systematic literature review and a thorough process involving the whole Noklus, a nationwide POC organization, a scoring system for when to analyze IQC was developed. Four factors were considered to significantly impact IQC frequency: The importance of the analyte in diagnosing and monitoring patients, type of POCT device, user-friendliness, and number of patient samples. For each POCT device, the first three factors were given a score, and the sum of the scores determined the general recommended IQC frequency. The number of patient samples determined whether and how to adjust these frequencies in each individual general practice. Results The scoring system was applied to 17 analytes and 134 different POCT devices (153 analyte-device combinations). Most of the devices analyzing high-risk analytes (71 out of 74) obtained daily or weekly IQC frequency. For example, all blood-cell counters and all glucose meters should undergo IQC daily and weekly, respectively. Conclusions This study presents a consensus-based scoring system for differentiated and device-specific recommendations for IQC frequency on POCT devices in primary healthcare. The scoring system can easily be adopted to other local environments and is easy to use.",17

","Objectives Defensive medicine has originally been defined as motivated by fear of malpractice litigation. However, the term is frequently used in Europe where most countries have a no-fault malpractice system. The objectives of this systematic review were to explore the definition of the term ‘defensive medicine’ in European original medical literature and to identify the motives stated therein. Design Systematic review. Data sources PubMed, Embase and Cochrane, 3 February 2020, with an updated search on 6 March 2021. Methods Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses, we reviewed all European original peer-reviewed studies fully or partially investigating ‘defensive medicine’. Results We identified a total of 50 studies. First, we divided these into two categories: the first category consisting of studies defining defensive medicine by using a narrow definition and the second category comprising studies in which defensive medicine was defined using a broad definition. In 23 of the studies(46%), defensive medicine was defined narrowly as: health professionals’ deviation from sound medical practice motivated by a wish to reduce exposure to malpractice litigation. In 27 studies (54%), a broad definition was applied adding … or other self-protective motives. These self-protective motives, different from fear of malpractice litigation, were grouped into four categories: fear of patient dissatisfaction, fear of overlooking a severe diagnosis, fear of negative publicity and unconscious defensive medicine. Studies applying the narrow and broad definitions of defensive medicine did not differ regarding publication year, country, medical specialty, research quality or number of citations. Conclusions In European research, the narrow definition of defensive medicine as exclusively motivated by fear of litigation is often broadened to include other self-protective motives. In order to compare results pertaining to defensive medicine across countries, future studies are recommended to specify whether they are using the narrow or broad definition of defensive medicine.

","ABSTRACT
Mantle cell lymphoma is a rare and aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma with a high propensity for extranodal involvement, typically seen in the liver, marrow, and gastrointestinal system. Being an FDG-avid disease and a sensitive modality for detecting both nodal and extranodal disease, FDG PET/CT is recommended in the workup of mantle cell lymphoma. We present a rare pattern of cutaneous involvement of the head-neck region in a patient with mantle cell lymphoma, which can be described on FDG PET/CT as a ""hood sign.""",35

","The monitoring of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in bacterial pathogens of animals is not currently coordinated at European level. To fill this gap, experts of the European Union Joint Action on Antimicrobial Resistance and Healthcare Associated Infections (EU-JAMRAI) recommended building the European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance network in Veterinary medicine (EARS-Vet). In this study, we (i) identified national monitoring systems for AMR in bacterial pathogens of animals (both companion and food-producing) among 27 countries affiliated to EU-JAMRAI, (ii) described their structures and operations, and (iii) analyzed their respective strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT). Twelve countries reported having at least one national monitoring system in place, representing an opportunity to launch EARS-Vet, but highlighting important gaps in AMR data generation in Europe. In total, 15 national monitoring systems from 11 countries were described and analyzed. They displayed diverse structures and operations, but most of them shared common weaknesses (e.g., data management and representativeness) and common threats (e.g., economic vulnerability and data access), which could be addressed collectively under EARS-Vet. This work generated useful information to countries planning to build or improve their system, by learning from others’ experience. It also enabled to advance on a pragmatic harmonization strategy: EARS-Vet shall follow the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) standards, collect quantitative data and interpret AMR data using epidemiological cut-off values.",31

Our aims were to: (1) Review how consumer access to price and availability information is engaged within the Medicine Access discourse and (2) identify factors associated with the existence of interventions that provide consumers with medicine availability and price information. We conducted two scoping reviews. We reviewed 26 medicine access and pharmaceutical system strengthening frameworks to assess how they conceptualise information access. We then reviewed four interventions that provide consumers with availability and price information to identify the factors associated with these interventions’ existence. We found that in the medical access discourse, information is mainly cast as helpful to entities that ensure medicine access for populations. Information as an enabler of medicine procurement for consumers/households is less emphasised. We then identified the following eight factors that facilitate consumer access to reliable medicine price and availability information: the recognition of a medicine access problem that can be mitigated by consumer access to information; cross-sectoral collaboration; the willingness of medicine sellers to disclose their inventory information; having information quality control measures; appropriate incentives for intervention adoption; enabling legal environments; systems of pooling information; and access to digital information technology infrastructure. We recommend that more theoretical and implementation attention ought to be directed at how medicine price and medicine availability information can empower individual consumers to make sound purchasing decisions.",35

","Introduction Digital therapeutics (DTx) can be a valuable contribution to the successful scale up of P5 Medicine (personalized, participatory, predictive, preventive, precision medicine) as they offer powerful means of delivering personalization and active patient participation in disease self-management. We investigated how the approval and adoption of DTx within health systems have been approached in five selected European countries and regions, with a view to proposing success factors scaling up their adoption. Methodology Preliminary research established best countries or region candidates as being Germany, UK, France, Belgium, and the Spanish Region of Catalonia. The research was informed by a literature review, interviews with public bodies and industry, and a multi-stakeholder workshop to validate the findings and fill in existing gaps. Results To authorize the use of digital technologies, the countries and regions passed legislation and developed policy instruments, appointed bodies to assess and certify the products and formalized mechanisms for permitting reimbursement. While DTx is not a commonly used nomenclature, there are digital health technology types defined that have similar requirements as DTx. Assessment and certification frameworks are usually built around the Medical Device Regulation with additional criteria. Reimbursement considerations often observe reimbursement of therapeutic devices and/or medicines. To be integrated into reimbursement systems, countries require manufacturers to demonstrate clinical value and cost-effectiveness. As there are currently very few DTx approved in practice, there is resistance toward clinical acceptance and organizational change, and change management is highly needed to integrate DTx into healthcare systems. The integration and secondary use of DTx data is not encountered in daily practice. Although some enablers exist, there remain technical and legal barriers. Discussion DTx strategies should be considered as an integral part of digital health strategies and legislation, and specific DTx pathways with clear and transparent assessment and guidelines that balance regulation and innovation should be defined. To help manufacturers, countries should recommend and list methods that are widely accepted and ensure scientific robustness, aligned to the MDR requirements to support transfer of relevant and comparable data across countries. To facilitate rapid uptake of innovation, countries should add flexibility to the framework by allowing temporary market authorization to enable data collection that can support the clinical and socio-economic evaluation and data gathering phase. Certification should trigger rapid price setting and reimbursement mechanisms, and dynamic ways to adjust price and reimbursement levels in time should be established. Relevant stakeholders should be approached on the potential impacts of DTx through transparent communication and change management strategies should be considered. These findings should be validated with a wider range of stakeholders.",35

","Mobile health (mHealth) applications provide equal reach to health care services at an affordable cost. mHealth can play a major role in enhancing the quality and access of health services in developing countries, still the adoption of mHealth in these countries is very low. On the other hand, younger generations have great dependence on mobile devices and have high potential to adopt mobile applications. The aim of this study is to investigate factors that affect user acceptance of mobile health recommender system among Generations Z (between 10 and 25 years old) & Y (between 26 and 40 years old). The research adopts Technology Acceptance Model (TAM3) constructs and extends them to include constructs related to Trust and Reputation, as mHealth is prone to uncertainty and vulnerability. Based on 136 valid responses collected from a survey, structural equation modelling SEM was employed to examine the research questions. The data were analyzed using the Partial Least Squares (PLS) method. The results suggested that for generations Z & Y, Perceived Usefulness has a significant positive effect on behavioral intention to use mobile health recommender system. This direct relationship is affected by user characteristics, namely gender and experience using technology. Perceived Ease of Use and Trust in mHealth applications, significantly increase the Perceived Usefulness. The results reveal the importance of perceived reputation in building Trust in mHealth applications, and it is found that Output Quality has a positive influence on Reputation. Computer anxiety has a negative effect on Perceived Ease of Use. These findings provide a basis for improving the understanding toward factors affecting mHealth applications in developing countries.

","INTRODUCTION
Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) is a commonly used treatment for a variety of medical issues, including more than a dozen currently approved uses. However, there are alternative proposed uses that have significant implications among an active duty military or veteran population as treatments for PTSD, mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), and traumatic brain injury (TBI). These applications have seen a recent groundswell of support from the operator and veteran communities, raising the visibility of using HBOT for alternative applications. The current review will cover the existing evidence regarding alternative uses of HBOT in military medicine and provide several possibilities to explain the potential conflicting evidence from empirical results.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
There were no inclusion or exclusion criteria for articles addressing currently approved HBOT uses as covered under the military health system. These references were provided for comparison and illustration as needed. For alternative HBOT uses, the review focuses explicitly upon three alternative uses in PTSD, mTBI, and TBI. The review addresses any piece of case study evidence, observational data, quasi-experimental design, or randomized-controlled trial that explored any or a combination of these issues within an active duty population, a veteran population, or a civilian population.


RESULTS
The existing medical evidence does not support a consensus viewpoint for these alternative uses of HBOT. Based on the literature review, there are four competing positions to explain the lack of consistency among the empirical results. These possibilities are described in no particular order. First, an explanation suggests that the results are because of placebo effects. The combination of participant expectations and subjective symptom reporting creates the potential that reported improvements are because of placebo rather than casual mechanisms. Second, another position suggests that experiments have utilized sham conditions which induced therapeutic benefits. If sham conditions have actually been weakened active treatment conditions, rather than placebo controls, it could explain the lack of observed significant differences in randomized clinical trials. Third, there has been a substantial amount of heterogeneity both in the symptoms treated and the treatments applied. This heterogeneity could explain the inconsistency of the data and the difficulty in reaching a consensus viewpoint. Fourth, the HBOT treatments may actively treat some tangential medical issue the patient is having. The treatment would thus promote an environment of healing without directly treating either PTSD, mTBI, or TBI, and the reduction in orthogonal medical issues facilitates a pathway to recovery by reducing tangential medical problems.


CONCLUSIONS
The mixed empirical evidence does not support recommending HBOT as a primary treatment for PTSD, mTBI, or TBI. If applied under the supervision of a licensed military medical professional, the consistently safe track record of HBOT should allow it to be considered as an alternative treatment for PTSD, mTBI, or TBI once primary treatment methods have failed to produce a benefit. However, the evidence does warrant further clinical investigation with particular emphasis on randomized clinical trials, better placebo controls, and a need to develop a consistent treatment protocol.",7

","Autoimmune thyroid diseases (AITD) are T-cell-mediated organ specific autoimmune disorders, deriving from an altered response of the immune system that leads to the immune attack to the thyroid. Hashimoto’s thyroiditis (HT) and Graves’ disease (GD) are the two principal AITD clinical presentations. Hypothyroidism and thyrotoxicosis are, respectively, the clinical hallmarks of HT and GD. Patients with autoimmune thyroiditis are treated daily with synthetic L-thyroxine (L-T4) at the dose of 1.5–1.7 μg/kg. Various L-T4 formulations are commercially available (tablet, liquid solution, or soft gel capsule). L-T4 in tablets is generally prescribed to treat hypothyroidism, whereas the liquid formulation, or soft gel capsules, can be administered in hypothyroid patients in case of malabsorption or in patients in therapy with drugs interfering with L-T4 absorption. Furthermore, myoinositol has a crucial role in thyroid autoimmunity and function. Clinical studies reported a significant decline in TSH and antithyroid autoantibodies levels after treatment with myoinositol + selenium in patients with subclinical hypothyroidism and autoimmune thyroiditis. Moreover, thyroidectomy can be rarely recommended in patients with autoimmune thyroiditis, with cosmetic reasons for a goiter, or with important signs or symptoms of local compression, or nodular disease with a “suspicious” cytology for malignancy. Furthermore, a recent randomized trial suggested that total thyroidectomy can improve quality of life and fatigue, while medical therapy did not. In this review, we overview currently available evidence in personalized medicine in patients with autoimmune thyroiditis and hypothyroidism. Further research is needed in larger population to investigate the effect of these new treatments on quality of life.",35

","Indie games often lack visibility as compared to top-selling games due to their limited marketing budget and the fact that there are a large number of indie games. Players of top-selling games usually like certain types of games or certain game elements such as theme, gameplay, storyline. Therefore, indie games could leverage their shared game elements with top-selling games to get discovered. In this paper, we propose an approach to improve the discoverability of indie games by recommending similar indie games to gamers of top-selling games. We first matched 2,830 itch.io indie games to 326 top-selling Steam games. We then contacted the indie game developers for evaluation feedback and suggestions. We found that the majority of them (67.9%) who offered verbose responses show positive support for our approach. We also analyzed the reasons for bad recommendations and the suggestions by indie game developers to lay out the important requirements for such a recommendation system. The most important ones are: a standardized and extensive tag and genre ontology system is needed to bridge the two platforms, the expectations of players of top-selling games should be managed to avoid disappointment, a player’s preferences should be integrated when making recommendations, a standardized age restriction rule is needed, and finally, the recommendation tool should also show indie games that are the least similar or less popular.",1

","The use of email marketing campaigns in e-commerce is an essential aspect for driving sales and establishing or maintaining good customer service. However, ensuring their success in the airline industry is challenging, and the risk is high that the marketing campaign content is not suited to the needs of specific travelers. The traveler may rapidly feel spammed and the offer content promoted via emails may even be no longer accessed. Consequently, the use of personalised recommender systems for email marketing campaigns becomes essential to build user loyalty and to increase offer conversion. Recently, the use of knowledge graphs has proven to be an effective way to recommend products. In this work, we propose an approach that leverages knowledge graph embeddings to better target the right audience in email marketing campaigns for airline products recommendation. We conduct extensive experiments to compare our approach with the currently in-production rule-based system used by airline marketers and a supervised machine learning model based on handcrafted features as another baseline. The results suggest that the use of knowledge graph embeddings is the most effective approach.",49

This research proposes a novel method to develop a knowledge-based recommender system from unstructured (text) data. The method is based on applying an opinion mining algorithm, extracting aspect-based sentiment score per text item, and transforming text into a structured form. An action rule mining algorithm is applied to the data table constructed from sentiment mining. The proposed application of the method is the problem of improving customer satisfaction ratings. The results obtained from the dataset of customer comments related to the repair services were evaluated with accuracy and coverage. Further, the results were incorporated into the framework of a web-based user-friendly recommender system to advise the business on how to maximally increase their profits by introducing minimal sets of changes in their service.

","Recommender systems are essential engines to deliver product recommendations for e-commerce businesses. Successful adoption of recommender systems could significantly influence the growth of marketing targets. Collaborative filtering is a type of recommender system model that uses customers' activities in the past, such as ratings. Unfortunately, the number of ratings collected from customers is sparse, amounting to less than 4%. The latent factor model is a kind of collaborative filtering that involves matrix factorization to generate rating predictions. However, using only matrix factorization would result in an inaccurate recommendation. Several models include product review documents to increase the effectiveness of their rating prediction. Most of them use methods such as TF-IDF and LDA to interpret product review documents. However, traditional models such as LDA and TF-IDF face some shortcomings, in that they show a less contextual understanding of the document. This research integrated matrix factorization and novel models to interpret and understand product review documents using LSTM and word embedding. According to the experiment report, this model significantly outperformed the traditional latent factor model by more than 16% on an average and achieved 1% on an average based on RMSE evaluation metrics, compared to the previous best performance. Contextual insight of the product review document is an important aspect to improve performance in a sparse rating matrix. In the future work, generating contextual insight using bidirectional word sequential is required to increase the performance of e-commerce recommender systems with sparse data issues.",4

Data were gathered through focus groups, in-depth individual interviews, and qualitative questionnaires and analyzed thematically. The results revealed positive attitudes toward integrating traditional medicine in Ghana and a discursive discourse of power relations. The power imbalance between biomedical and traditional practitioners regarding what integrative models to adopt is sanctioned by formal education and institutional structure. As a result, multiple approaches for integration were made, including patient co-referrals, collaborations between biomedical and traditional medical practitioners, and creating a unit for traditional medicine and healers at the outpatients’ department for patients to choose either biomedicine or traditional medicine. Incorporating aspects of traditional healing in the training of biomedical practitioners and creating a space for knowledge sharing were also proposed.

","Numerous reviews are posted every day on travel information sharing platforms and sites. Hotels want to develop a customer recommender system to quickly and effectively identify potential target customers. TripAdvisor, the travel website that provided the data used in this study, allows customers to rate the hotel based on six criteria: Value, Service, Location, Room, Cleanliness, and Sleep Quality. Existing studies classify reviews into positive, negative, and neutral by extracting sentiment terms through simple sentimental analysis. However, this method has limitations in that it does not consider various aspects of hotels well. Therefore, this study performs fine-tuning the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model using review data with rating labels on the TripAdvisor site. This study suggests a multi-criteria recommender system to recommend a suitable target customers for the hotel. As the rating values of six criteria of TripAdvisor are insufficient, the proposed recommender system uses fine-tuned BERT to predict six criteria ratings. Based on this predicted ratings, a multi-criteria recommender system recommends personalized Top-N customers for each hotel. The performance of the multi-criteria recommender system suggested in this study is better than that of the benchmark system, a single-criteria recommender system using overall ratings.",24

","Providing real-time product recommendations based on consumer profiles and purchase history is a successful marketing strategy in online retailing. However, brick-and-mortar (BAM) retailers have yet to utilize this important promotional strategy because it is difficult to predict consumer preferences as they travel in a physical space but remain anonymous and unidentifiable until checkout. In this paper, we develop such a recommender approach by leveraging the consumer shopping path information generated by radio frequency identification technologies. The system relies on spatial-temporal pattern discovery that measures the similarity between paths and recommends products based on measured similarity. We use a real-world retail data set to demonstrate the feasibility of this real-time recommender system and show that our approach outperforms benchmark methods in key recommendation metrics. Conceptually, this research provides generalizable insights on the correlation between spatial movement and consumer preference. It makes a strong case that the emerging location and path data and the spatial-temporal pattern discovery methods can be effectively utilized for implementable marketing strategies. Managerially, it provides one of the first real-time recommender systems for BAM retailers. Our approach can potentially become the core of the next-generation intelligent shopping environment in which the stores customize marketing efforts to provide real-time, location-aware recommendations.",19

","Dear Editor, In June 2018, the Australasian College for Emergency Medicine (ACEM) commissioned an expert working group to inform the College’s advocacy position on whether time-based targets (TBT) should be used as a health system performance measure. After systematically reviewing all published studies on the topic, the emergency physicians in the group were asked to use a critical appraisal tool to determine whether ED length of stay is a reasonable quality indicator that should be advocated for by ACEM. Before deciding to recommend a quality indicator, there are important characteristics to be considered alongside evidence of improved outcomes. Does the indicator have face validity for stakeholders? Is it reliable, precise and cost-effective? Can it introduce bias? How feasible is it to implement? This evaluation was prospectively registered (PROSPERO CRD4201910775) and ethics approval was not required. The Quality Indicator Critical Appraisal (QICA) tool was chosen for the evaluation. It measures 23 attributes regarding quality indicators. Eight working group members completed the analysis. All had reviewed multiple manuscripts on the topic, both qualitative and quantitative, prior to undertaking their appraisal. Appraisers also received training in how to use the QICA tool prior to its deployment. The appraisers concluded that TBT strongly reflect processes of care and to some extent outcomes of care. They are acceptable to users, can be used to identify inequities for different patient groups, can be adjusted for bias between different sites and populations and are ethical. It is practical to collect and analyse data (Appendices S1a and S1b). Targets reflect access to and timeliness of care and are efficient and patient centred (Fig. 1). They reflect throughput and output phases of emergency care and measure whole system performance more strongly than emergency performance. There was debate around whether targets were effective, safe or reflected patient-centred equitable care. Most thought that gaming targets was possible. There were concerns that conflicts of interest may arise when measuring target performance at a local level and interestingly. Only half of the appraisers thought the cost and utility of targets were worthwhile. Although there was incomplete agreement on all attributes, the ‘bottom line’ scores were similar: mean 7.4 out of 10 (95% confidence intervals 6.6, 8.2; range 6.4, 9.4), which favoured use of TBT as health system quality indicators (Appendix S1c). The strength of this appraisal was that the process of making a recommendation was thorough, systematic and explicit, using a structured checklist tool. This reduced the chance of recommendations made based on personal experience alone. To our knowledge, this is the first time that formal consideration has been given to how TBTs perform as quality indicators. The recommendation of the QICA analysis group is that TBT for emergency length of stay should be used. This recommendation is conditional on appropriate safeguards being built into the performance regimen, both at the local and regional level, to mitigate against the potential for gaming and unintended consequences.",44

","Background An appropriate regulatory system to ensure and promote the quality, safety, and efficacy of the products of traditional medicine (TM) and complementary medicine (CM) is critical to not only public health but also economic growth. The regulatory approach and evaluation standards for TM/CM products featured with a long history of use are yet to be developed. This study aims to investigate and compare the existing regulatory approaches for TM/CM products with a long history of use. Method A mixed approach of documentary analysis involving official and legal documents from official websites, as well as a scoping review of scholarly work in scientific databases about regulatory systems of TM/CM products in China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan, and Korea, was employed in this study and used for comparison. Results For registration purposes, all five regulatory systems recognized the history of use as part of the totality of evidence when evaluating the safety and efficacy of TM/CM products with a long history of use. Generally, the list of classic formulas is predefined and bound to the formulas recommended in the prescribed list of ancient medical textbooks. Expedited pathways are usually in place and scientific data of nonclinical and clinical studies may be exempted. At the same time, additional restrictions with the scope of products constitute a comprehensive approach in the regulation. Quality assurance and postmarketing safety surveillance were found to be the major focus across the regulatory schemes investigated in this study. Conclusion The regulatory systems investigated in this study allow less stringent registration requirements for TM/CM products featured with a long history of use, assuming safety and efficacy to be plausible based on historic use. Considering the safety and efficacy of these products, regulatory standards should emphasize the technical requirements for quality control and postmarket surveillance.",50

","Objective This review sought to evaluate the strength and validity of the existing evidence for the use of Chinese medicine for the treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Methods We retrieved systematic evaluations and meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating Chinese herbal interventions in polycystic ovaries, including the use of decoctions or Chinese patent medicines. The quality of these systematic evaluations was assessed using AMSTAR2 tools, and ovulation rate, pregnancy rate, effective rate, serum hormones (testosterone, luteinizing hormone, and follicle-stimulating hormone), and adverse reactions were recorded. Finally, the reliability of each result was evaluated according to the GRADE system. Data Sources. PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang Data, CQVIP, and SINOMED databases were searched up to January 1, 2021. Outcomes. A total of 18 publications were included, all of which showed that PCOS symptoms were improved with Chinese medicine compared with control groups. However, most of the evaluations did not have good research designs and had issues with the analysis of their results. The reliability of most outcome measures was rated low or very low, and it is presumed that the reliability of the results was low due to the poor quality of the RCTs. Conclusions At present, there is insufficient evidence to suggest that improved efficacy is achieved by the combined use of Chinese and Western medicine compared with Western medicine alone in treating PCOS. Therefore, it is recommended that multicenter, large-sample RCTs adopting standard designs and rigorous methods be carried out in the future while introducing standardized assessment plans for the systematic review of clinical trials so as to improve the quality of the resulting clinical evidence.",35

","Machine Learning (ML) techniques have been increasingly adopted by the real estate market in the last few years. Applications include, among many others, predicting the market value of a property or an area, advanced systems for managing marketing and ads campaigns, and recommendation systems based on user preferences. While these techniques can provide important benefits to the business owners and the users of the platforms, algorithmic biases can result in inequalities and loss of opportunities for groups of people who are already disadvantaged in their access to housing. In this work, we present a comprehensive and independent algorithmic evaluation of a recommender system for the real estate market, designed specifically for finding shared apartments in metropolitan areas. We were granted full access to the internals of the platform, including details on algorithms and usage data during a period of 2 years. We analyze the performance of the various algorithms which are deployed for the recommender system and asses their effect across different population groups. Our analysis reveals that introducing a recommender system algorithm facilitates finding an appropriate tenant or a desirable room to rent, but at the same time, it strengthen performance inequalities between groups, further reducing opportunities of finding a rental for certain minorities.",37

","Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques have been sought after as the next-generation tools to further advance the field of recommendation research. Different from classic applications of RL, recommender agents, especially those deployed on commercial recommendation platforms, have to operate in extremely large state and action spaces, serving a dynamic user base in the order of billions, and a long-tail item corpus in the order of millions or billions. The (positive) user feedback available to train such agents is extremely scarce in retrospect. Improving the sample efficiency of RL algorithms is thus of paramount importance when developing RL agents for recommender systems. In this work, we present a general framework to augment the training of model-free RL agents with auxiliary tasks for improved sample efficiency. More specifically, we opt to add additional tasks that predict users' immediate responses (positive or negative) toward recommendations, i.e., user response modeling, to enhance the learning of the state and action representations for the recommender agents. We also introduce a tool based on gradient correlation analysis to guide the model design. We showcase the efficacy of our method in offline experiments, learning and evaluating agent policies over hundreds of millions of user trajectories. We also conduct live experiments on an industrial recommendation platform serving billions of users and tens of millions of items to verify its benefit.",10

","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES
The implementation of effective competency-based medical education (CBME) relies on building a coherent and integrated system of assessment across the continuum of training to practice. As such, the developmental progression of competencies must be assessed at all stages of the learning process, including continuing professional development (CPD). Yet, much of the recent discussion revolves mostly around residency programs. The purpose of this review is to synthesize the findings of studies spanning the last 2 decades that examined competency-based assessment methods used in family medicine residency and CPD, and to identify gaps in their current practices.


METHODS
We adopted a modified form of narrative review and searched five online databases and the gray literature for articles published between 2000 and 2020. Data analysis involved mixed methods including quantitative frequency analysis and qualitative thematic analysis.


RESULTS
Thirty-seven studies met inclusion criteria. Fourteen were formal evaluation studies that focused on the outcome and impact evaluation of assessment methods. Articles that focused on formative assessment were prevalent. The most common levels of educational outcomes were performance and competence. There were few studies on CBME assessment among practicing family physicians. Thematic analysis of the literature identified several challenges the family medicine educational community faces with CBME assessment.


CONCLUSIONS
We recommend that those involved in health education systematically evaluate and publish their CBME activities, including assessment-related content and evaluations. The highlighted themes may offer insights into ways in which current CBME assessment practices might be improved to align with efforts to improve health care.",46

","With the advancement of data-intensive technologies, such as image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT) and intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), the amount and complexity of data to be transferred between clinical subsystems have increased beyond the reach of manual checking. As a result, unintended treatment deviations (e.g., dose errors) may occur if the treatment system is not closely monitored by a comprehensive data transfer quality management program (QM). This report summarizes the findings and recommendations from the Task Group (TG) on Quality Assurance (QA) of External Beam Treatment Data Transfer (TG-201), with the aim to assist medical physicists in designing their own data transfer QM. As a background, a section of this report describes various models of data flow (distributed data repositories and single data base systems) and general data test characteristics (data integrity, interpretation, and consistency). Recommended tests are suggested based on the collective experience of TG-201 members. These tests are for the acceptance of, commissioning of and upgrades to subsystems that store and/or modify clinical treatment data. As treatment complexity continues to evolve, we will need to do and know more about ensuring the quality of data transfers. The report concludes with the recommendation to move towards data transfer open standards compatibility and to develop tools that automate data transfer QA.",33

","Supporting personal health with Decision Support Systems (DSS) and, specifically, recommender systems (RS) is a promising and growing area of research. Integrating the user in the loop is vital in such health systems due to the complexity of recommendations, gravity of the decisions and the reliance on user autonomy. However, for such a purpose, to the best of our knowledge there exists no profound or comprehensive framework nor model to guide system designers, to exploit the full potential of integrating users in the system’s reasoning process by design. In this paper, we present a multifaceted user integration framework in personal health-related DSS and RS. This framework, with three main components, has been derived from an iterative mixed-methods development and evaluation procedure, including expert workshops and extensive multidisciplinary literature reviews. Users are accordingly integrated into the whole process from system reasoning until decision making through the following actionable design strategies: (1) Empower: Enabling them to understand the result generation and implications, (2) Encourage: encouraging them to question and reflect system outcomes and to get involved in the generation process and (3) Engage: enabling them to take an active role by facilitating and providing opportunities for user control. The framework offers support to designers of personal health-related DSS and RS in properly integrating users into their systems.",19

","Recommender systems (RS) work effective at alleviating information overload and matching user interests in various web-scale applications. Most RS retrieve the user’s favorite candidates and then rank them by the rating scores in the greedy manner. In the permutation prospective, however, current RS come to reveal the following two limitations: 1) They neglect addressing the permutationvariant influence within the recommended results; 2) Permutation consideration extends the latent solution space exponentially, and current RS lack the ability to evaluate the permutations. Both drive RS away from the permutation-optimal recommended results and better user experience. To approximate the permutation-optimal recommended results effectively and efficiently, we propose a novel permutation-wise framework PRS in the re-ranking stage of RS, which consists of Permutation-Matching (PMatch) and Permutation-Ranking (PRank) stages successively. Specifically, the PMatch stage is designed to obtain the candidate list set, where we propose the FPSA algorithm to generate multiple candidate lists via the permutation-wise and goal-oriented beam search algorithm. Afterwards, for the candidate list set, the PRank stage provides a unified permutation-wise ranking criterion named LR metric, which is calculated by the rating scores of elaborately designed permutation-wise model DPWN. Finally, the list with the highest LR score is recommended to the user. Empirical results show that PRS consistently and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, PRS has achieved a performance improvement of 11.0% on PV metric and 8.7% on IPV metric after the successful deployment in one popular recommendation scenario of Taobao application.",7

","Advances in medical science simultaneously benefit patients while contributing to an over-whelming complexity of medicine with a decision space of thousands of possible diagnoses, tests, and treatment options. Medical expertise becomes the most important scarce health-care resource, reflected in tens of millions in the US alone with deficient access to specialty care. Combining the growing wealth of electronic medical record data with modern recommender algorithms has the potential to synthesize the clinical community's expertise into an executable format to manage this information overload and improve access to personalized care suggestions. We focus here specifically on outpatient consultations for (Endocrine) specialty expertise, one of the highest demand and most amenable areas for electronic consultation systems. Specifically we develop and evaluate models to predict the clinical orders of these initial specialty referral consultations using an ensemble of feed-forward neural networks as compared to multiple baseline algorithms. As benchmarks closer to the existing standard of care, we used diagnosis-based clinical checklists based on our review of literature and practice guidelines (e.g., Up-to-Date) for each common referral diagnosis as well as existing electronic consult referral guides. Results indicate that such automated algorithms trained on historical data can provide more personalized decision support with greater accuracy than existing benchmarks, with the potential to power fully digital consultation services that could consolidate utilization of scarce medical expertise, improving consistency of quality and access to care for more patients.",47

","OBJECTIVE
This study aims at exploring the dynamics of health-care provision during recent unplanned public mass gatherings in Beirut, and how the health-care system adapts to mass movements in protests.


METHODS
A qualitative study was conducted using semi-structured interviews with 12 health-care providers who volunteered at medical tents set during protests in Beirut, Lebanon. Responses were transcribed and coded.


RESULTS
Three themes were noted: preparedness and logistics, encountered cases, and participants' proposed recommendations. In terms of preparedness and logistics, participants lacked knowledge of field medicine protocols and an organizational structure. They faced difficulties in securing equipment and advertising their services. Most encountered cases were physical injuries rather than mental health problems. The participants proposed both short-term recommendations, including advice on how to boost care provided, and long-term recommendations on structuring the health-care system to be better prepared.


CONCLUSIONS
On-site health-care provision during unplanned mass gatherings is a vital need. We recommend forming a task force of health-care workers from various fields led by the Ministry of Public Health in every respective country to plan protocols, train personnel, and secure resources beforehand.",28

","Abstract A National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine committee developed a plan to implement high-quality primary care. One of the 5 key objectives was designing information technology that serves the patient, family, and interprofessional care team. The committee defined high-quality primary care as the provision of whole person, integrated, accessible, and equitable healthcare by interprofessional teams who are accountable for addressing most of an individual’s health across settings and through sustained relationships. The committee recommended 2 essential actions for digital health. The first action is developing the next phase of digital health certification standards that support relationship-based, continuous, person-centered care; simplify user experience; ensure equitable access; and hold vendors accountable. Second, the committee recommended adopting a comprehensive aggregate patient data system usable by any certified digital health tool. This article reviews primary care’s digital health needs and describes successful digital health for primary care.",26

","Abstract Hippocratic doctrine of four humors and qualities is implicated to be a pioneer of modern endocrinology because of the concept of dyscrasia. Imbalance in humors causes disease. Unani scholars were aware of endocrinological disorders like endocrinologic syndrome (i.e., association of amenorrhea and galactorrhoea in a non-pregnant woman), castration, contraceptives techniques, infertility, obesity, diabetes etc., and also their mode of remedy, albeit with a phenomenological approach. Their understanding of the symptoms and signs related to endocrinologic syndromes, which were explained in detail in the recent account of the endocrine system, is presented here with historical chronology. The survey was carried out from the literature of the Unani system of medicine, and the same was analyzed from the observations reported in various indexed journals and reputed books. The paper details the account of endocrinologic syndrome from the Greek era to the end of the medieval ages. Highlights – Description of the endocrinal disorders is mentioned in Unani Medicine for centuries, albeit with a different name for the disease category. – According to Unani Medicine, this disease arises due to abnormal quality and quantity of humour. – Renowned Unani scholars like Hippocrates (370–460 BC), Aristotle (384–322 BC), Aretaeos of Kappadokia(81–96 AD), Galen (130–200 AD), Zakaria Razi (865–925 AD), Majusi (930–994 AD), Ibn-e-Sina (980–1037 AD), Albucasis (1013–1106 AD) and Ismail Jorjani (1042–1137 AD) also treated such ailments through Unani medicine (plant, mineral and animal origin drugs). – Majusi performed surgery of Goiter and mentioned in his treatise and recommended the method of surgery. – Albucasis performed the first successful thyroidectomy under opium (Papaver somniferum L.) sedation and simple ligatures and hot cautery in the name of ‘elephantiasis’ of the throat (goiter). – The principles of treatment in Unani medicine may provide a guide for better management of endocrinal disorders (e.g., hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, diabetes etc.). – The treatment in Unani medicine for various diseases/syndromes/signs, which are now likely associated with hormone dysfunction, can open up the new field of Unani therapeutics for these diseases for the exploration of better treatment options.",34

","Family physicians provided primary health care for patients, families, and communities despite great risks to themselves and their loved ones throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Our comprehensive scope of practice provides us with unique perspectives regarding the basic conditions needed for all people to thrive such as safety, shelter, education, recreation, social support, access to healthy food, and primary health care. The pandemic or more appropriately, the syndemic, has revealed gaps and amplified health inequities within our nation and the world.1 Despite spending more money on health care than any other nation, the health of the US population lags behind most in other high-income nations.2-3 The challenge to address disparities and strive for health equity motivated the Association of Departments of Family Medicine (ADFM) to launch a new Advocacy Committee. Family Medicine (FM) advocacy encompasses actions inspired by our experiences to promote individual, health system, social, economic, educational, and/or political changes that promote human health and well-being.4 Advocacy actions can occur at the micro (clinical environment), meso (local community), or macro (national or global) policy level.5 Effective advocacy includes identifying the problem; gathering information; committing to action; collaborating with others; mobilizing resources; and sustaining efforts to bring about change. Family physicians are natural advocates for their patients, although many have never been trained and may not be comfortable with all levels of advocacy. The aims of the ADFM Advocacy Committee are to (1) identify opportunities for advocacy; (2) amplify the voice of family physicians; (3) support FM department advocacy efforts; and (4) identify and share advocacy resources. For example, family physicians can promote the recent National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) report that calls for widespread changes in the US health care system to support primary care as a common good.6 The report includes 5 aims: 1. Pay for primary care teams to care for people, not doctors to deliver services 2. Ensure primary care is available to every individual and community 3. Train primary care teams where people live and work 4. Design information technology that serves the patient, family, and the interprofessional care team 5. Ensure high-quality primary care is implemented throughout the United States Family physicians can engage with local and state legislators to support the first aim. Many states have introduced legislation to increase funding for primary care, also supported by the Primary Care Collaborative (PCC).7 In some cases, legislation starts with establishing a clear definition of primary care and measuring the percentage of total medical expenditures allocated to primary care. The NASEM report recommends increasing primary care support and shifting from feefor-service to global payments. The NASEM report calls for appropriate regulatory and legislative rules to ensure safe, ethical, and anti-racist application of new technologies, along with appropriate reimbursement to support the patient-physician relationship. Electronic health records (EHRs) have been both an ally and an albatross for practicing physicians.8 EHR implementation was designed to improve the quality of care, but the lack of interoperability has created a number of problems.9 The promise of health care portals for patients to access their own information is often thwarted by difficulties with access and navigability. AAFP has supported efforts to make IT more accessible and affordable to PCPs, protect patient privacy, and ensure standards and protocols that allow health care information to flow between physicians, payers, patients, and pharmacies.10 Other advocacy efforts have included automating prior authorizations and monitoring the impact of telehealth on access and equity. Family physicians can contribute to the development of new technologies such as artificial intelligence or advanced learning systems to strengthen primary care.11 We continue to endure a syndemic that affects us profoundly in terms of health, social connections, and economics. COVID-19 disparities, the Black Lives Matter movement, police violence, and climate change have deepened our understanding of the extreme health and social inequities that disproportionately affect disadvantaged individuals and communities. The NASEM report describing primary care as a public good emphasizes the need for family physicians to respond with coordinated and thoughtful advocacy efforts that can dramatically change investment in primary care and demonstrate our commitment to social justice and health equity. These events present a oncein-a-lifetime opportunity for fundamental changes.",46

","Target selection is a basic yet often implicit decision in the configuration of offline recommendation experiments. In this paper we research the impact of target sampling on the outcome of comparative recommender system evaluation. Specifically, we undertake a detailed analysis considering the informativeness and consistency of experiments across the target size axis. We find that comparative evaluation using reduced target sets contradicts in many cases the corresponding outcome using large targets, and we provide a principled explanation for these disagreements. We further seek to determine which among the contradicting results may be more reliable. Through comparison to unbiased evaluation, we find that minimum target sets incur in substantial distortion in pairwise system comparisons, while maximum sets may not be ideal either, and better options may lie in between the extremes. We further find means for informing the target size setting in the common case where unbiased evaluation is not possible, by an assessment of the discriminative power of evaluation, that remarkably aligns with the agreement with unbiased evaluation.",7

","Over the years, the recommender systems (RS) have witnessed an increasing growth for its enormous benefits in supporting users’ needs through mapping the available products to users based on their observed interests towards items. In this setting, however, more users, items and rating data are being constantly added to the system, causing several shifts in the underlying relationship between users and items to be recommended, a problem known as concept drift or sometimes called temporal dynamics in RS. Although the traditional techniques of RS have attained significant success in providing recommendations, they are insufficient in providing accurate recommendations due to concept drift problems. These issues have triggered a lot of researches on the development of dynamic recommender systems (DRSs) which is focused on the design of temporal models that will account for concept drifts and ensure more accurate recommendations. However, in spite of the several research efforts on the DRSs, only a few secondary studies were carried out in this field. Therefore, this study aims to provide a systematic literature review (SLR) of the DRSs models that can guide researchers and practitioners to better understand the issues and challenges in the field. To achieve the aim of this study, 87 papers were selected for the review out of 875 total papers retrieved between 2010 and 2019, after carefully applying the inclusion/exclusion and the quality assessment criteria. The results of the study show that concept drift is mostly applied in the multimedia domain, then followed by the e-commerce domain. Also, the results showed that time-dependent neighborhood models are the popularly used temporal models for DRS followed by the Time-dependent Matrix Factorization (TMF) and time-aware factors models, specifically Tensor models, respectively.

","Higher Education plays a principal role in the changing and complex world of today, and there has been rapid growth in the scientific literature dedicated to predicting students’ academic success or risk of dropout thanks to advances in Data Mining techniques. Degrees such as Computer Science in particular are in ever greater demand. Although the number of students has increased, the number graduating is still not enough to provide society with as many as it requires. This study contributes to reversing this situation by introducing an approach that not only predicts the dropout risk or students’ performance but takes action to help both students and educational institutions. The focus is on maximizing graduation rates by constructing a Recommender System to assist students with their selection of subjects. In particular, the challenge is addressed of constructing reliable Recommender Systems on the basis of data which are both sparse and few in quantity, imbalanced, and anonymized, and which might have been stored under imperfect conditions. This approach is successfully applied to create a Recommender System using a real-world dataset from a public Spanish university containing performance data of a Computer Science degree course, demonstrating its successful application in real environments. The construction of a support system based on that approach is described, its results are evaluated, and its implications for students’ academic achievement, and for institutions’ graduation rates are discussed. Through the construction of this decision support system for students, we intend to increase the graduation rates and lower the dropout rate.",23

","Introduction Different therapies are currently used, considered, or proposed for the treatment of COVID-19; for many of those therapies, no appropriate assessment of effectiveness and safety was performed. This document aims to provide scientifically available evidence-based information in a transparent interpretation, to subsidize decisions related to the pharmacological therapy of COVID-19 in Brazil. Methods A group of 27 experts and methodologists integrated a task-force formed by professionals from the Brazilian Association of Intensive Care Medicine (Associação de Medicina Intensiva Brasileira - AMIB), the Brazilian Society of Infectious Diseases (Sociedad Brasileira de Infectologia - SBI) and the Brazilian Society of Pulmonology and Tisiology (Sociedade Brasileira de Pneumologia e Tisiologia - SBPT). Rapid systematic reviews, updated on April 28, 2020, were conducted. The assessment of the quality of evidence and the development of recommendations followed the GRADE system. The recommendations were written on May 5, 8, and 13, 2020. Results Eleven recommendations were issued based on low or very-low level evidence. We do not recommend the routine use of hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, azithromycin, lopinavir/ritonavir, corticosteroids, or tocilizumab for the treatment of COVID-19. Prophylactic heparin should be used in hospitalized patients, however, no anticoagulation should be provided for patients without a specific clinical indication. Antibiotics and oseltamivir should only be considered for patients with suspected bacterial or influenza coinfection, respectively. Conclusion So far no pharmacological intervention was proven effective and safe to warrant its use in the routine treatment of COVID-19 patients; therefore such patients should ideally be treated in the context of clinical trials. The recommendations herein provided will be revised continuously aiming to capture newly generated evidence.",54

","Ranking algorithms are pervasive in our increasingly digitized societies, with important real-world applications including recommender systems, search engines, and influencer marketing practices. From a network science perspective, network-based ranking algorithms solve fundamental problems related to the identification of vital nodes for the stability and dynamics of a complex system. Despite the ubiquitous and successful applications of these algorithms, we argue that our understanding of their performance and their applications to real-world problems face three fundamental challenges: (1) rankings might be biased by various factors; (2) their effectiveness might be limited to specific problems; and (3) agents’ decisions driven by rankings might result in potentially vicious feedback mechanisms and unhealthy systemic consequences. Methods rooted in network science and agent-based modeling can help us to understand and overcome these challenges.",31

","Objective To understand doctors’ attitude to and awareness of AYUSH therapies for the treatment of diabetes mellitus (DM). Methods This qualitative study, using a usage-and-attitude survey, was conducted in secondary centers across Mumbai, India. The study surveyed 77 physicians, including those specializing in diabetes. Results The majority of doctors were aware of Ayurveda (69%) and Homeopathy (52%). Some doctors were aware of Unani (34%) and Siddha (32%). Most doctors (60%) thought that Ayurveda was effective in some way. Almost all doctors (97%) thought that allopathic medicine was effective for DM. The majority of doctors (68%) had not recommended AYUSH therapies as an adjunct to modern medicines. Approximately half of the doctors (52%) believed that AYUSH therapies posed a safety concern for patients and 46% thought that AYUSH therapies could not be used to manage any form of DM. A large group of doctors thought that the main barrier preventing AYUSH therapies from being integrated into current allopathic management of DM was the lack of strong scientific evidence and clinical trials. Conclusion The majority of doctors are aware to some degree of Ayurveda and homeopathic forms of treatment. The majority believe that AYUSH therapies pose a safety concern for patients and have no role in treatment for any form of DM. The most common barrier preventing AYUSH therapies from becoming a mainstream treatment option for DM is the lack of scientific evidence. From this sample, it seems that greater efforts are required to conduct research into the efficacy and safety of AYUSH therapies to ensure that doctors are able to provide holistic care for patients with DM.",33

","Asthma puts a tremendous overhead on healthcare. To enable effective preventive care to improve outcomes in managing asthma, we recently created two machine learning models, one using University of Washington Medicine data and the other using Intermountain Healthcare data, to predict asthma hospital visits in the next 12 months in asthma patients. As is common in machine learning, neither model supplies explanations for its predictions. To tackle this interpretability issue of black-box models, we developed an automated method to produce rule-style explanations for any machine learning model’s predictions made on imbalanced tabular data and to recommend customized interventions without lowering the prediction accuracy. Our method exhibited good performance in explaining our Intermountain Healthcare model’s predictions. Yet, it stays unknown how well our method generalizes to academic healthcare systems, whose patient composition differs from that of Intermountain Healthcare. This study evaluates our automated explaining method’s generalizability to the academic healthcare system University of Washington Medicine on predicting asthma hospital visits. We did a secondary analysis on 82,888 University of Washington Medicine data instances of asthmatic adults between 2011 and 2018, using our method to explain our University of Washington Medicine model’s predictions and to recommend customized interventions. Our results showed that for predicting asthma hospital visits, our automated explaining method had satisfactory generalizability to University of Washington Medicine. In particular, our method explained the predictions for 87.6% of the asthma patients whom our University of Washington Medicine model accurately predicted to experience asthma hospital visits in the next 12 months.",9

","The proliferation of location-aware social networks (LSNs) has facilitated the research of user mobility modeling and check-in prediction, thereby benefiting various downstream applications such as precision marketing and urban management. Most of the existing studies only focus on predicting the spatial aspect of check-ins, whereas the joint inference of the spatial and temporal aspects more fits the real application scenarios. Moreover, although social relations have been extensively studied in a recommender system, only a few efforts have been observed in the next check-in location prediction, leaving room for further improvement. In this article, we study the next check-in inference problem, which demands the joint inference of the next check-in location (Where) and time (When) for a target user (Who). We devise a model named ARNPP-GAT, which combines an attention-based recurrent neural point process with a graph attention networks. The core technical insight of ARNPP-GAT is to integrate user long-term representation learning, short-term behavior modeling, and temporal point process into a unified architecture. Specifically, ARNPP-GAT first leverages graph attention networks to learn the long-term representation of users by encoding their social relations. More importantly, the ARNPP endows the model with the capability of characterizing the effects of past check-in events and performing multitask learning to yield the next check-in time and location prediction. Empirical results on two real-world data sets demonstrate that ARNPP-GAT is superior compared with several competitors, validating the contributions of multitask learning and social relation modeling.",31

To achieve this goal, we elaborated on a hypertensive user profile model, called HyperModel2PAR, and a physical activity recommender system for hypertensive patients, called HyperRecSysPA. The model resulting from this study is composed of 32 elements divided into three groups, which were used in the modeling of user profiles within the system for generating HyperRecSysPA recommendations.

","The autopsy rate in Japan is lower than that in other countries, and most death investigations have historically been conducted by police officers through external inspection. Although medicolegal autopsy was not performed during the samurai administration, the European death investigation system was adopted in the second half of the 19th century and judicial autopsy began in universities’ forensic medicine departments. After World War II, the medical examiner system was introduced under US influence, but it was only adopted in certain areas. Further reforms were introduced in the 21st century—in 2012, two laws relating to death investigation were enacted: The Act on Promotion of Death Investigation (Promotion Act), which provided foundational principles and included measures for investigating the causes of death and identification of bodies, and the Act on the Investigation of Cause of Death and on Identification of Bodies Handled by the Police, which recommended a procedure for death investigation, including a new autopsy system. The Death Investigation Promotion Program was to meant to be decided by the government in 2014. However, the relevant Act expired after it ran out of time. Later, in 2019, the Basic Act for Promotion of Death Investigation, the successor to the Promotion Act, was passed. This Act is significant because it sets the basic foundational principle and imposes plans created by the government. However, it remains unclear how these measures can be implemented, so further discussion and financial investment are now required.",8

Previous research has demonstrated that biases in user profiles in the aggregate can influence the recommendations to users who do not share the majority preference. One consequence of this bias propagation effect is miscalibration, a mismatch between the types or categories of items that a user prefers and the items provided in recommendations. In this paper, we conduct a systematic analysis aimed at identifying key characteristics in user profiles that might lead to miscalibrated recommendations. We consider several categories of profile characteristics, including similarity to the average user, propensity towards popularity, profile diversity, and preference intensity. We develop predictive models of miscalibration and use these models to identify the most important features correlated with miscalibration, given different algorithms and dataset characteristics. Our analysis is intended to help system designers predict miscalibration effects and to develop recommendation algorithms with improved calibration properties.",13

","In his third edition of the book Lifestyle Medicine, James Rippe, MD, has continued his leadership in the lifestyle medicine arena by coordinating a detailed summary of the scientific evidence behind the rapidly growing field of lifestyle medicine. This comprehensive 1435-page volume is divided into 126 chapters, all organized into 20 sections, each separately coordinated and edited. In total, over 250 authors contributed their subject expertise, ensuring a scientific breadth and perspective that is completely unmatched in the discipline of lifestyle medicine. Although the book is most remarkable for its comprehensive depth, this third edition has also been organized in a practical way that includes key points as each chapter begins, and clinical applications at the end of each chapter. The clinical application sections include recommended actions as well as tools and resources for implementing those actions, adding usefulness for practicing lifestyle medicine physicians and health care professionals. In this third edition, there are 2 new sections not present in the second edition. The Practice of Lifestyle Medicine section, authored by leading practitioners of lifestyle medicine, adds, among others, practical summaries of lifestyle medicine definitions, core competencies, clinical practices, and intensive therapeutic lifestyle change programs. The Substance Abuse and Addiction section recognizes that whether its addiction to nicotine, opioids, or other substances, successful treatment is critical in the practice of lifestyle medicine, and in fact the principles are core to all health behavior change. Lifestyle medicine pillars are addressed in the sections on nutritional aspects of lifestyle medicine, physical activity, and a stand-alone section on behavioral medicine. There are also separate practical sections on lifestyle medicine–related topics such as obesity and weight management, exercise psychology, injury prevention, and cardiovascular rehabilitation. Organor system-related sections include the role of lifestyle medicine in cardiovascular disease, endocrinology, cancer, infectious disease, pulmonary medicine, and obstetrics and gynecology. Other sections focus on the application of lifestyle medicine to specific populations, including sections on women’s health, pediatrics, and geriatrics. Finally, there are practical sections on health promotion as well as public policy and environmental supports for lifestyle medicine. Lifestyle Medicine, third edition, more so than either of the previous editions, incorporates and summarizes various discussions and debates found globally throughout the lifestyle medicine movement. Specifically, in the field of nutrition, the value of whole food plant-based approaches are reviewed in multiple sections, but the science behind other dietary methodologies are also evaluated and summarized. Although some lifestyle medicine practitioners might not agree with all the documented conclusions, or ask for a stronger review of certain lifestyle medicine areas such as 869394 AJLXXX10.1177/1559827619869394American Journal of Lifestyle MedicineAmerican Journal of Lifestyle Medicine book-review2019",35

","Search engines and recommender systems pervade everyday life and continuously make decisions regarding what information should be retrieved and how it should be ranked in order to meet the user’s information needs on the user’s behalf. Unfortunately, bias affects automated decision systems and as a consequence fairness cannot be taken for granted. Understanding whether and how bias affects search results can be a necessary and useful condition to every user and designer who aims to investigate the reasons that the systems fail or succeed. In this paper, we discuss whether Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) can be a useful methodology to investigate the causal relationships between the variables describing the content representation and retrieval processes of search engines and recommender systems. Understanding how and why a retrieval system retrieves certain documents can help understand when the system provides biased results. To this end, we provide a general illustration of the issues and the potential of SEM for causal discovery in Information Retrieval.",25

","Cervical ectopy is one of the commonest gynecological conditions seen in OPD’s, about 80-85% of women suffer from cervical ectopy during their life time. Many a times, it is an accidental finding in an asymptomatic woman coming for routine gynecological examination. Although it is a benign lesion, but may predispose to complications like infertility, cervical intraepithelial neoplasm, risk of various sexually transmitted infections like C. trachomatis, N. gonorrhoea, human papilloma virus, human immunodeficiency virus, cytomegalovirus and shows malignant changes as it progresses. Ectopy occurs when the columnar epithelium lining the endocervix, extends onto the ectocervix. As the disease takes 10-20 years to progress from pre invasive to invasive disease, preventive measures such as screening and treatment modalities should be adopted. Early diagnosis of cervical ectopy is important for its effective management and for prevention of its long-term sequel. The treatment option available in conventional medicine includes surgical procedure either electro or, cryocautery, but have their own complications. Hence, this treatment is limited due to its complications and contraindications and need for safer alternate therapy. In Unani system of medicine, various formulations are available as treatment of quruhal rahim, which have been recommended to be used locally in the form of humool for immediate healing of wound, exhibiting the properties of anti-inflammatory (muhallile warm), desiccant (mujaffif), wound healing (mundamile qurooh), sedative (musakkin), antiseptic (dafa’e ta’ffun) etc. This review article gives a detailed description of cervical ectopy as mentioned in classical Unani text including its etiopathogenesis, clinical presentation and principles of treatment as well as evidence-based Unani medicine.",34

","The purpose of this report is to provide detailed guidance on the dosimetry of the INTRABEAM® (Carl Zeiss Medical AG, Jena, Germany) electronic brachytherapy (eBT) system as it stands at the present time. This report has been developed by the members of American Association of Physicists in Medicine (AAPM) Task Group 292 and endorsed by the AAPM. Members of AAPM Task Group 292 on Electronic-Brachytherapy Dosimetry have reviewed pertinent publications and user manuals regarding the INTRABEAM system dosimetry and manufacturer-supplied dose calculation protocols. Formal written correspondence with Zeiss has also provided further clarification. Dose rate calculations for the INTRABEAM system are highly dependent on choice of dosimetry protocol. Even with careful protocol selection, large uncertainties remain due to the incomplete characterization of the ionization chambers used for verification with respect to their energy dependence as well as manufacturing variations. There are two distinct sets of dose-rate data provided by Zeiss for the INTRABEAM system. One dataset (Calibration V4.0) is representative of the physical dose surrounding the source and the other dataset (TARGIT) has been adjusted to be consistent with a clinical trial named TARGIT (TARGeted Intraoperative RadioTherapy). The adjusted TARGIT doses are quite dissimilar to the physical doses, with differences ranging from 14% to 30% at the surface of a spherical applicator, depending on its diameter, and up to a factor of two at closer distances with the smaller needle applicators. In addition, ion chamber selection and associated manufacturing tolerances contribute to significant additional uncertainties. With these substantial differences in dose rates and their associated uncertainties, it is important for users to be aware of how each value is calculated and whether it is appropriate to be used for the intended treatment. If users intend to deliver doses that are the same as they were in 1998 at the onset of the TARGIT trial, then the TARGIT dose-rate tables should be used. The Calibration V4.0 dose rates may be more appropriate to use for applications other than TARGIT trial treatments, since they more closely represent the physical doses being delivered. Users should also be aware of the substantial uncertainties associated with the provided dose rates, which are due to beam hardening, chamber geometry, and selection of the point-of-measurement for a given ionization chamber. This report serves to describe the details and implications of the manufacturer-recommended dosimetry formalism for users of the INTRABEAM system.",33

","Inferring customers’ preferences and recommending suitable products is a challenging task for companies, although recommender systems are constantly evolving. Loyalty is an indicator that measures the preference relationship between customers and products in the field of marketing. To this end, the aim of this study is to explore whether customer loyalty can improve the accuracy of the recommender system. Two algorithms based on complex networks are proposed: a recommendation algorithm based on bipartite graph and PersonalRank (BGPR), and a recommendation algorithm based on single vertex set network and DeepWalk (SVDW). In both algorithms, loyalty is taken as an attribute of the customer, and the relationship between customers and products is abstracted into the network topology. During the random walk among nodes in the network, product recommendations for customers are completed. Taking a real estate group in Malaysia as an example, the experimental results verify that customer loyalty can indeed improve the accuracy of the recommender system. We can also conclude that companies are more effective at recommending customers with moderate loyalty levels.",19

","Classical recommender system methods typically face the filter bubble problem when users only receive recommendations of their familiar items, making them bored and dissatisfied. To address the filter bubble problem, unexpected recommendations have been proposed to recommend items significantly deviating from user’s prior expectations and thus surprising them by presenting ”fresh” and previously unexplored items to the users. In this paper, we describe a novel Personalized Unexpected Recommender System (PURS) model that incorporates unexpectedness into the recommendation process by providing multi-cluster modeling of user interests in the latent space and personalized unexpectedness via the self-attention mechanism and via selection of an appropriate unexpected activation function. Extensive offline experiments on three real-world datasets illustrate that the proposed PURS model significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline approaches in terms of both accuracy and unexpectedness measures. In addition, we conduct an online A/B test at a major video platform Alibaba-Youku, where our model achieves over 3% increase in the average video view per user metric. The proposed model is in the process of being deployed by the company.",10

","Fog computing is an emergent computing paradigm that extends the cloud paradigm. With the explosive growth of smart devices and mobile users, cloud computing no longer matches the requirements of the Internet of Things (IoT) era. Fog computing is a promising solution to satisfying these new requirements, such as low latency, uninterrupted service, and location awareness. As a typical new computing paradigm and network architecture, fog computing raises new challenges, such as privacy, data management, data analytics, information overload, and participatory sensing. In this article, we present a fog-based hybrid recommender system to address the issue of information overload in fog computing. Our proposed system not only abstracts useful information from the fog environment but can also be considered as an optimization tool due to its ability to provide suggestions to improve system performance. In particular, we demonstrate that the proposed system provides personalized and localized recommendations to users, and also advise the system itself to precache the content to optimize the storage capacity of the fog server.",7

","Recommender systems have fulfilled an important role in everyday life. Recommendations such as news by Google, videos by Netflix, goods by e-commerce providers, etc. have heavily changed everyones lifestyle. Health domains contain similar decision-making problems such as what to eat, how to exercise, and what is the proper medicine for a patient. Recently, studies focused on recommender systems to solve health problems have attracted attention. In this paper, we review aspects of health recommender systems including interests, methods, evaluation, future challenges and trend issues. We find that 1) health recommender systems have their own health concern limitations that cause them to focus on less-risky recommendations such as diet recommendation; 2) traditional recommender methods such as content-based and collaborative filtering methods can hardly handle health constraints, but knowledge-based methods function more than ever; 3) evaluating a health recommendation is more complicated than evaluating a commercial one because multiple dimensions in addition to accuracy should be considered. Recommender systems can function well in the health domain after the solution of several key problems. Our work is a systematic review of health recommender system studies, we show current conditions and future directions. It is believed that this review will help domain researchers and promote health recommender systems to the next step.",19

","With the availability of a large amount of user-generated online data, discovering users’ sequential behaviour has become an integral part of a Sequential Recommender System (SRS). Combining the recent observed items (i.e., short-term preferences) with prior interacted items (i.e., long-term preferences) has gained increasing attention in recent years. However, the existing methods mostly assume that all the adjacent items in a sequence are highly dependent, which may not be practical in real-world scenarios due to the uncertainty of customers’ shopping behaviours. A user-item interaction sequence may contain some irrelevant items which may in turn lead to false dependencies between items. Moreover, current studies usually assign a static representation to each item when modeling a user’s long-term preferences. Therefore, they cannot differentiate the contributions of the items. Specifically, these two types of users’ preferences have been separately modeled and then linearly combined, which may fail to model complicated user-item interactions. In order to overcome the above mentioned problems, we propose a novel Deep Attention-based Sequential (DAS) model. DAS consists of three different blocks, <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$(i)$ </tex-math></inline-formula> <italic>an embedding block:</italic> which embeds users and items into low-dimensional spaces; <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$(ii)$ </tex-math></inline-formula> <italic>an attention block:</italic> which aims to discriminatively learn dependencies among items in both users’ long-term and short-term item sets; and <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$(iii)$ </tex-math></inline-formula> <italic>a fully-connected block</italic>: which first learns a mixture of users’ preferences representation through a nonlinear way and then combines it with users’ embeddings to have a personalized recommendation.

","The global infrastructure of the Web, designed as an open and transparent system, has a significant impact on our society. However, algorithmic systems of corporate entities that neglect those principles increasingly populated the Web. Typical representatives of these algorithmic systems are recommender systems that influence our society both on a scale of global politics and during mundane shopping decisions. Recently, such recommender systems have come under critique for how they may strengthen existing or even generate new kinds of biases. To this end, designers and engineers are increasingly urged to make the functioning and purpose of recommender systems more transparent. Our research relates to the discourse of algorithm awareness, that reconsiders the role of algorithm visibility in interface design. We conducted online experiments with 105 participants using MTurk for the recommender system Recoin, a gadget for Wikidata. In these experiments, we presented users with one of a set of three different designs of Recoin's user interface, each of them exhibiting a varying degree of explainability and interactivity. Our findings include a positive correlation between comprehension of and trust in an algorithmic system in our interactive redesign. However, our results are not conclusive yet, and suggest that the measures of comprehension, fairness, accuracy and trust are not yet exhaustive for the empirical study of algorithm awareness. Our qualitative insights provide a first indication for further measures. Our study participants, for example, were less concerned with the details of understanding an algorithmic calculation than with who or what is judging the result of the algorithm.",7

","Software Engineering is a discipline that encompasses processes associated with the development of interactive systems. The perceived quality of an interactive system is heavily influenced by the user interface design, which may result in many challenges. One such challenge is design-level requirements analysis. The success of the software system is mostly dependent on how well users’ requirements have been understood and translated into appropriate functionalities. During the interactive system design process, it is common to find recurring problems in human–computer interactions, for which reusing solutions is highly feasible. Interaction design patterns seek to support designers in decision making during the design of interactive systems. Due to the design task tends to be subjective and prone to errors. This work aims at presenting and evaluating an interaction design patterns recommendation model based on design-level requirements classification, through the application of supervised machine learning algorithms. To compare the performance of four classification algorithms, a study was carried out, in which the linear support vector machine was the most suitable to this problem. The results of this work can be used for implementing frameworks that can better support designers’ decision making when designing user interfaces.",10

","Most commercial industrial recommender systems have built their closed feedback loops. Though it is helpful in item recommendation and model training, the closed feedback loop may lead to the so-called bias problems, including the position bias, selection bias and popularity bias. The recommendation models trained with biased may hurt the user experiences by recommending homogenous items. How to control the biases in the closed feedback loop has become one of major challenges in modern recommender systems. This talk discusses the counterfactual learning technologies for tackling the bias problem in recommendation. The talk consists of four parts. The first part, briefly introduces the counterfactual learning with two cases from the academic perspective [4, 5]. The second part illustrates the position bias and selection bias based on two real examples. These examples inspire us to study “How to use counterfactual technology for recommender system?” from the industry perspective. In the third part, we firstly encourage the audiences to think an important question: “What kind of data can learn an unbiased model?” After that, we propose four counterfactual learning approaches and related studies, as shown in Figure1. Approach 1: Learn from counterfactual data. We need to learn full-information model with partial observed information data. The full-information model is an unbiased model, which is trained by both observed data and unobserved data (including counterfactual data), but how to model unobserved data? One common approach is direct method [2]. In this talk, we introduce a novel counterfactual learning framework [8], first, an imputation model can by learned by a small amount of unbiased uniform data, then the imputation model can be used to predict labels of all counterfactual samples, finally, we train a counterfactual recommendation model with both observed and counterfactual samples. Approach 2: Correct biased observed data. Inverse propensity score (IPS) is a widely studied method and relatively easy to be deployed for real products. IPS is defined as the conditional probability of receiving the treatment given pre-treatment covariates by Rosenbaum and Rubin [7]. But IPS method should satisfy two assumptions: (1) overlap, and (2) unconfoundedness. Inspired by the sample reweighting work for robust deep learning [6], we proposed a novel influence function based method to reweight training samples directly. Approach 3: Doubly robust method. The doubly robust methods [7] have two parts: IPS method part and direct method part. John Langford etc. prove that either one part of them can debias, the doubly robust method can debias. But both of the propensity and imputation model are not easy to learn, so we present a novel propensity free doubly robust method [8] for click-through-rate (CTR) prediction task. In order to solve the efficiency of full samples (including both unobserved and observed sample) learning problem, we proposed block coordinate descend and conjugate gradient method, which can reduce the time complexity of optimization from O(m*n) to O(m+n). Approach 4: Joint learning unbiased data and biased data. In recommender system, unbiased data is collected through randomly recommendation approach. The unbiased data is less, and its collection process is expensive. Through online A/B testing, the performance of the model trained with biased data and unbiased data together is superior to the performance of the model trained with only biased data. Causal embedding [1] method is another method to learn both biased data and unbiased data for improving the accuracy of prediction model. We also propose a general knowledge distillation framework for counterfactual recommendation via uniform data [3], which propose a general framework about how to use unbiased data with four distillation methods: label distillation, sample distillation, feature distillation and model structure distillation. We also summarize the advantages and challenges of the above approaches. The last part emphasizes that counterfactual learning is a rich research area, and discuss several important research topics, such as optimization for counterfactual learning, counterfactual meta learning, stable learning, fairness, unbiased learning to rank, offline policy evaluation.",12

","Big consumer data promises to be a game changer in applied and empirical marketing research. However, investigations of how big data helps inform consumers’ psychological aspects have, thus far, only received scant attention. Psychographics has been shown to be a valuable market segmentation path in understanding consumer preferences. Although in the context of e-commerce, as a component of psychographic segmentation, personality has been proven to be effective for prediction of e-commerce user preferences, it still remains unclear whether psychographic segmentation is practically influential in understanding user preferences across different product categories. To the best of our knowledge, we provide the first quantitative demonstration of the promising effect and relative importance of psychographic segmentation in predicting users’ online purchasing preferences across different product categories in e-commerce by using a data-driven approach. We first construct two online psychographic lexicons that include the Big Five Factor (BFF) personality traits and Schwartz Value Survey (SVS) using natural language processing (NLP) methods that are based on behavior measurements of users’ word use. We then incorporate the lexicons in a deep neural network (DNN)-based recommender system to predict users’ online purchasing preferences considering the new progress in segmentation-based user preference prediction methods. Overall, segmenting consumers into heterogeneous groups surprisingly does not demonstrate a significant improvement in understanding consumer preferences. Psychographic variables (both BFF and SVS) significantly improve the explanatory power of e-consumer preferences, whereas the improvement in prediction power is not significant. The SVS tends to outperform BFF segmentation, except for some product categories. Additionally, the DNN significantly outperforms previous methods. An e-commerce-oriented SVS measurement and segmentation approach that integrates both BFF and the SVS is recommended. The strong empirical evidence provides both practical guidance for e-commerce product development, marketing and recommendations, and a methodological reference for big data-driven marketing research.",33

","Most of product recommender systems in marketing are based on artificial intelligence algorithms using machine learning or deep learning techniques. One of the current challenges for companies is to avoid negative effects of these product recommender systems on customers (or prospects), such as unfairness, biais, discrimination, opacity, encapsulated opinion in the implemented recommender systems algorithms. This research focuses on the fairness challenge. We first make a literature review on the importance and challenges of using ethical algorithms. Second, we define the fairness concept and present the reasons why it is important for companies to address this issue in marketing. Third, we present the different methodologies used in recommender systems algorithms. Using a dataset in the entertainment industry, we measure the algorithm fairness for each methology and compare the results. Finally, we improve the existing methods by proposing a new product recommender system aiming at increasing fairness versus previous methods, without compromising the recommendation systems performance.",42

","ABSTRACT To address inconsistencies in the recognition and management of acute kidney injury (AKI), an electronic-alert (e-alert) system was implemented by NHS England in 2015. This study aimed to describe its impact within acute medicine in the West Midlands. All admissions to included acute medical units were screened for AKI in two phases, before and after the e-alert was introduced. Data describing recognition and management of patients with AKI were collected. In the 10 units that participated in both phases, recognition of AKI by clinicians significantly improved from 67.9% in 2015 to 76.1% in 2016 (p=0.04). Further analysis of the data found that the presence of an e-alert had a limited effect on recognition and management, suggesting it was not the primary cause of the improvements. Multiple avenues of research have been recommended to clarify the impact of the e-alert system and to improve deficiencies in management that were identified in the data.",26

","Background and Aim: Burnout is a common problem for interns and residents. It has been associated with physical and mental health of health care providers as well as low job satisfaction and medical errors. Few studies have investigated this problem among residents. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of burnout and its associated factors among family residents in Al Madina city, Saudi Arabia. Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted among 75 residents in the family medicine residency programs in Al Madina, Saudi Arabia. A self-administered questionnaire was used that includes questions on sociodemographic characteristics and sources of stress and burnout. T test, analysis of variance (ANOVA) test, and multiple linear regression analysis were employed. Results: Majority were female (54.7%) and aged 26 to 30 years (84.0%). The significant predictors of burnout in the final model were “tests/examinations” (P = 0.014), “large amount of content to be learnt” (P = 0.016), “unfair assessment from superiors” (P = 0.001), “work demands affect personal/home life” (P = 0.001), and “lack of support from superiors” (P = 0.006). Conclusion: Burnout is present among family medicine residents at a relatively high percentage. This situation is strongly triggered by work-related stressors, organizational attributes, and system-related attributes, but not socio-demographics of the respondents. Systemic changes to relieve the workload of family medicine residents are recommended to promote effective management of burnout.",46

","Systems Biology in Reproductive Medicine 2019 carries forward the advances observed in 2018 as the pace in our field continues to accelerate. With a rising impact factor along with the number of papers submitted for consideration, we continue to champion a bench to bedside philosophy. The journal emphasizes systems-based research within the framework of Personalized and Precision Reproductive Medicine that is increasingly becoming a part of standard clinical care. It serves to emphasize our interest in providing a well-balanced blend of the male and female reproductive medicine and sciences papers reflective of each contribution to the birth of a healthy child. Animal studies andmodel systems offer insights into what would be considered intractable questions when addressed in the human system. By continuing to cast a wide net, our journal promotes synergy in research covering both clinical and agricultural applications. Our Board continues to grow and reflect the breadth of interests represented in our journal. We are pleased to announce the election of the following five new Board members, each bringing their unique expertise. Dr. George Anifandis – University of Thessaly, Larisa, Greece, embryology and clinical sciences; Dr. Steven Korzeniewski – Wayne State University, Michigan, USA, biostatistics and experimental design; Dr. George Perry – South Dakota State University, South Dakota, USA, whose research spans the entire bovine life-cycle from gamete quality to longevity; Dr. Bhanu Telugu – University of Maryland, Maryland, USA, most noted for his recent work on genome editing in animal models; and Dr. Helen Tempest – Florida International University, Florida, USA, lending her expertise in chromatin structure and its modulation of gene expression. We welcome each of these new members as part of our Editorial Board team. In addition to the above changes to the Board, Dr. Michael Diamond, Augusta University, Georgia, USA, will now be serving as one of our Associate Editors and Dr. René Reijo Pera, Montana State University, Montana, USA, will now serve as an Editorial Board Member. We appreciate their continuing contribution. Dr. David Miller, University of Leeds, Leeds, United Kingdom, is retiring from the Board, and we thank him for his many years serving on the Board, his significant input to its development, and for recommending SBiRM as Systems Biology in Reproductive Medicine’s abbreviation. Dr. Jing Dai is also stepping down and we thank her for initiating a standardized statistical review of submitted manuscripts. We wish both the best of success in their new endeavors. We are also pleased to acknowledge this year’s cover figure for Volume 65 from the laboratory of Associate Editor Dr. Peter Sutovsky, Animal Science and Obstetrics, Gynecology & Women’s Health, University of Missouri, Missouri, USA.

","In face-to-face interactions, advice acceptance depends on how it is presented, as well as a number of social factors. For example, some persons are inclined to accept advice from an expert if they possess little domain knowledge. In contrast, if such advice is unsolicited, persons might only accept advice from a trusted source, such as a family member. Whether these mechanisms also play a role in the recommender context is unknown, even though advice solicitation may be particularly important in domains where a recommender user seeks behavioral change (e.g. energy conservation, healthy eating). This study examines the role of advice solicitation (i.e. whether one asks for advice or simply receives it) and advice source (i.e. either explained in social terms or not) in our 'Saving Aid' energy recommender system. Through a web-based user study with 252 participants, we find that allowing users to solicit advice themselves increases their perceived level of trust with our energy recommender system, compared to users that are presented unsolicited advice. In turn, we find that trust positively affects user satisfaction levels, as well as the number of chosen energy-saving measures. We discuss how system designers should consider how advice is presented and in which context.",37

","Background Smoking continues to be the leading preventable cause of death. Digital Interventions for Smoking Cessation (DISCs) are health communication programs accessible via the internet and smartphones and allow for greater reach and effectiveness of tobacco cessation programs. DISCs have led to increased 6-month cessation rates while also reaching vulnerable populations. Despite this, the impact of DISCs has been limited and new ways to increase access and effectiveness are needed. Objective We are conducting a hybrid effectiveness-dissemination study. We aim to evaluate the effectiveness of a machine learning–based approach (recommender system) for computer-tailored health communication (CTHC) over a standard CTHC system based on quit rates and risk reduction. In addition, this study will assess the dissemination of providing access to a peer recruitment toolset on recruitment rate and variability of the sample. Methods The Smoker-to-Smoker (S2S) study is a 6-month hybrid effectiveness dissemination trial conducted nationally among English-speaking, current smokers aged ≥18 years. All eligible participants will register for the DISC (Decide2quit) and be randomized to the recommender system CTHC or the standard CTHC, followed by allocation to a peer recruitment toolset group or control group. Primary outcomes will be 7-day point prevalence and risk reduction at the 6-month follow-up. Secondary outcomes include recruitment rate, website engagement, and patient-reported outcomes collected via the 6-month follow-up questionnaire. All primary analyses will be conducted on an intent-to-treat basis. Results The project is funded from 2017 to 2020 by the Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute. Enrollment was completed in early 2019, and 6-month follow-ups will be completed by late 2019. Preliminary data analysis is currently underway. Conclusions Conducting a hybrid study with both effectiveness and dissemination hypotheses raises some unique challenges in the study design and analysis. Our study addresses these challenges to test new innovations and increase the effectiveness and reach of DISCs. International Registered Report Identifier (IRRID) DERR1-10.2196/14814",37

","INTRODUCTION: The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends the integration of traditional medicine into each country's health systems by formulating and implementing national policies and laws in accordance with the country's own situation. This study aims to examine and analyze the national laws and regulations in Iran concerning the integration of traditional medicine into the health system of the country based on the WHO definition. METHODS: Policy document analysis was performed through content analysis according to the WHO components for the integration of traditional and complementary medicine (T&CM) into health systems. All government and state websites were explored to locate policy-associated documents and laws. Only documents were ultimately included in the study that had been approved by a senior official of a ministry. RESULTS: Nine policy documents related to T&CM were found. In these documents, reference was made to the availability of education (26 cases), regulation (20 cases), availability of therapies (17 cases), research (15 cases), and insurance coverage (7 items). CONCLUSIONS: While policies and laws on the integration of T&CM in Iran have been formulated, this research showed that these policies have been implemented slowly or, in cases, not implemented at all. The government and the Ministry of Health and Medical Education need to take measures in this regard after they have evaluated the policies and programs. Given the tendency of the Iranian people to T&CM, the insurance of T&CM and the development of clinics and hospitals should be prioritized.",50

","Although real-time dynamic recommender systems have been applied successfully by e-commerce and technology companies for more than a decade, we at IKEA Group have just started our journey into this exciting field. At IKEA, customer experience is at our heart, and a key principle for any machine learning algorithm that we design to improve this experience is that it should act as an extension to the home-furnishing expertise that our co-workers have developed and fine-tuned for more than 75 years. In this talk, we discuss a particular recommendation strategy that projects the inspirational shopping experience of our blue boxes onto our digital touch points by defining a notion of style from our vast collection of inspirational content. To go beyond classical, transaction-based collaborative filtering strategies, we take as our starting point the different types of images taken of each product when launched. Our current implementation relies on the following 3 types of images: (1) white-canvas, referring to an image of a product displayed on a plain white background; (2) context-based, which shows a product in the larger context of a room, but where emphasis remains on the product itself; (3) inspirational, in which a product is shown in a purposefully atmospheric setting with focus on the entirety. By extracting the product range displayed in our tagged inspirational images, we initially construct a graph of products that embeds the mindset of our talented designers. Add-to-cart recommendations are then generated from the resulting graph based on user-behaviour data collected from our digital touch points (app, web) and transactional data from purchases made online, or in one of our IKEA stores. To implement the strategy, we have come across a few interesting (stand-alone) problems along the way; notably, we faced a severe lack of properly tagged inspirational images, and much of our furniture today does not appear in our inspirational collection. To circumvent the latter observation, we pursue a supervised learning approach that automatically identifies products that 1) complement each other with regards to function, and 2) match in terms of style. We do this by taking product metadata attributes and the full collection of product images as input. We also discuss how we use a combination of features extracted from context-based and inspirational images using a pre-trained ImageNet model [2], together with manually tagged inspirational images and transaction data from stores to create our training data. The use of both context-based and inspirational images distinguishes us from similar methodologies in the fashion industry [1, 3] and enables us to capture the notion of complementary products in a satisfying way.",8

Purpose
The purpose of this paper is to develop a journal recommender system, which compares the content similarities between a manuscript and the existing journal articles in two subject corpora (covering the social sciences and medicine). The study examines the appropriateness of three text similarity measures and the impact of numerous aspects of corpus documents on system performance.


Design/methodology/approach
Implemented three similarity measures one at a time on a journal recommender system with two separate journal corpora. Two distinct samples of test abstracts were classified and evaluated based on the normalized discounted cumulative gain.


Findings
The BM25 similarity measure outperforms both the cosine and unigram language similarity measures overall. The unigram language measure shows the lowest performance. The performance results are significantly different between each pair of similarity measures, while the BM25 and cosine similarity measures are moderately correlated. The cosine similarity achieves better performance for subjects with higher density of technical vocabulary and shorter corpus documents. Moreover, increasing the number of corpus journals in the domain of social sciences achieved better performance for cosine similarity and BM25.


Originality/value
This is the first work related to comparing the suitability of a number of string-based similarity measures with distinct corpora for journal recommender systems.

Methods A two fold search strategy was adopted to obtain the literature; search through PUBMED and hand search through cross references. Of the 58 articles obtained through both the search approaches 13 articles were finally included in the review. Results The studies reviewed assessed the utilization, preference, perception and characteristics of people adopting traditional and AYUSH systems of medicine in India. Utilization was observed in a particular geographical area (states) and by a specific group of people such as tribal and general population, medical practitioners and religious groups. Perception about AYUSH system was mixed with different segments of the society. Preference among the general population revolved around distrust or frustration with allopathic medicine, cost effectiveness, accessibility, non-availability of other options and less side effects of AYUSH medicines. Moreover people primarily adopted AYUSH systems of medicine based on their personal experiences and recommended the same to other people as well. Conclusions A mixed response was observed through this systematic review with regard to utilization, preference, perception and characteristics of people adopting traditional and AYUSH systems of medicine in India. A higher level of awareness and governmental patronization is required to make it available to the common man at the last corner of the society for the benefit of the former and the system as well.",35

","ABSTRACT Objectives: Reducing the inappropriate benzodiazepine (BZD) prescriptions represents a challenge for health care systems worldwide. The ‘Choosing Wisely’ campaign recommends against the use of BZD in the elderly as the first choice for insomnia, agitation, or delirium. We aimed to determine whether a transparent monitoring-benchmarking together with educational interventions, on top of the internal publication of a targeted recommendation, could be effective in curbing BZD prescriptions. Methods: Multicenter before and after study in a network of five southern-Switzerland teaching hospitals. An intervention based on a transparent continuous monitoring-benchmarking system, called ‘Reporting Wisely’, able to collect, analyze, and report data on BZD prescriptions and educational interventions focused on themed meetings, audit, and feedback, was implemented. The intervention was limited to the Internal Medicine. The impact of the intervention on new BZD prescriptions and de-prescribing at hospital discharge, was assessed using segmented regression analyses of interrupted time-series and comparing Internal Medicine to Surgery. Results: Between July 1st2014, and June 30th2017, data of 45,597 hospital admissions, from Internal Medicine and Surgery departments were analyzed. Before the intervention (July 1st2014 to December 31st2015), the mean monthly new BZD prescription rate was 7.2%; value dropping to 5.5% (24% relative reduction; p < 0.001) in the intervention phase (January 1st2016 to June 30th2017). At the end of the intervention a 15% relative increase of BZD de-prescribing was also found (p < 0.01). The use of atypical antipsychotic (AAP) and other potentially harmful sedative drugs did not increase. In the surgery department, exposed to the recommendation but not to the intervention, a constant upward trend with a slope of 0.129 new prescriptions per 100 admissions per month (95% CI 0.08–0.17; p < 0.001) was seen. Conclusions: The implementation of a dual intervention based on transparent monitoring-benchmarking and multidisciplinary education has proved useful in curbing new BZD prescriptions and in promoting BZD de-prescribing in the hospital setting.",31

","PurposeThis study aims to discuss a context-aware system, SmartMedicist, which can recommend an alternative medicine from a set of available medicines present at a patient’s home for an unavailable medicine. The system is applied to the chronic disease patients only. The system requires only a smartphone, and provides a reminder to the patient to take medicine at appropriate times and to procure medicines from drug store. The system discusses the output method for the physically challenged patient. Although there are existing systems that can remind a patient for taking medicines, the authors are not aware of any such system that has the capability to recommend an alternative medicine for the prescribed medicine.Design/methodology/approachThe study developed a pharmacology knowledge base that consists of a representation of a set of diseases, according to family, type and medicines, in a k-ary tree. An alternative medicine is recommended based on the set of available medicines and knowledge base.FindingsWe considered four diseases: Hypertension, Gastritis, Alzheimer’s disease, and Parkinson; and performed several experiments for each disease for the different number of available medicines. The execution time to find an alternative medicine (if any) in each case is around four seconds.Originality/valueThe proposed system is cost effective and affordable for most families in India. Although the proposed system is not a substitute of a doctor, this system will enhance the safety golden period for a patient to consult a doctor in the emergency exhaustion of the prescribed medicines.",8

","Business to Business (B2B) marketing aims at meeting the needs of other businesses instead of individual consumers, and thus entails management of more complex business needs than consumer marketing. The buying processes of the business customers involve series of different marketing campaigns providing multifaceted information about the products or services. While most existing studies focus on individual consumers, little has been done to guide business customers due to the dynamic and complex nature of these business buying processes. To this end, in this paper, we focus on providing a unified view of social and temporal modeling for B2B marketing campaign recommendation. Along this line, we first exploit the temporal behavior patterns in the B2B buying processes and develop a marketing campaign recommender system. Specifically, we start with constructing a temporal graph as the knowledge representation of the buying process of each business customer. Temporal graph can effectively extract and integrate the campaign order preferences of individual business customers. It is also worth noting that our system is backward compatible since the participating frequency used in conventional static recommender systems is naturally embedded in our temporal graph. The campaign recommender is then built in a low-rank graph reconstruction framework based on probabilistic graphical models. Our framework can identify the common graph patterns and predict missing edges in the temporal graphs. In addition, since business customers very often have different decision makers from the same company, we also incorporate social factors, such as community relationships of the business customers, for further improving overall performances of the missing edge prediction and recommendation. Finally, we have performed extensive empirical studies on real-world B2B marketing data sets and the results show that the proposed method can effectively improve the quality of the campaign recommendations for challenging B2B marketing tasks.",53

We apply Goffman's frame analysis to a qualitative study of Scoopinion, a collaborative news recommender system that used tracked reading time to recommend articles from whitelisted websites. Based upon ten user interviews and one designer interview, we describe 1) the process through which reading was framed as a `datafied' activity and 2) how behavioral data was interpreted as socially meaningful and communicative, even in the absence of overtly social system features, producing what we term `implicit sociality'. We conclude with a discussion of how our findings about Scoopinion and its users speak to similar issues with more popular and more complex algorithmic systems.",29

","Abstract Sustained-release drug delivery systems that replace the need for daily glaucoma medications will improve outcomes for those who are nonadherent and reduce the inconvenience of having to take medications on a recurring basis. The objective is to estimate uptake (i.e., demand) for a new technology that delivers sustained-release glaucoma medication and to investigate how uptake varies by product attributes, physician recommendations, peer adoption (i.e., percentage of patients seen in a clinic using the new technology), and patient characteristics. In a web-enabled discrete-choice experiment survey, glaucoma patients in the United States were asked to choose between continuing eye drop use or purchasing the new delivery system. In a cross-sectional web-enabled survey, ophthalmologists were asked their likelihood of recommending the new technology based on product and patient characteristics. Study participants were 500 glaucoma patients who were on topical administration of daily eye drops and 155 ophthalmologists who practice in the US. Main outcomes were predicted uptake for patients and likelihood of recommending a new drug delivery system for ophthalmologists. Logistic models were used to analyze the choice data. Uptake was estimated to be 18% at an annual cost of $1000 and to be 24% when the cost was $500. A physician's recommendation increased uptake by 6% to 12%, whereas an increase in peer adoption from 5% to 50% increased uptake by 3% to 7%. Patients aged ≥ 65 and those with lower income were more likely to remain on eye drops. Physicians were more likely to recommend a product if the interval between administrations is 6 months or longer and when long-term safety and efficacy data are available. They were less likely to recommend it to patients with lower income and no adherence problems. Results suggest a significant interest in an injectable solution or other sustained-release alternatives to daily eye drops. However, in this survey, patient uptake was greatly influenced by out-of-pocket cost and the interval between treatment administrations. Few physicians were willing to recommend sustained-release technology if the treatment interval was less than 3 months.",35

","This paper studies how a recommender system may incentivize users to learn about a product collaboratively. To improve the incentives for early exploration, the optimal design trades off fully transparent disclosure by selectively over-recommending the product (or “spamming”) to a fraction of users. Under the optimal scheme, the designer spams very little on a product immediately after its release but gradually increases its frequency; and she stops it altogether when she becomes sufficiently pessimistic about the product. The recommender’s product research and intrinsic/naive users “seed” incentives for user exploration and determine the speed and trajectory of social learning. Potential applications for various Internet recommendation platforms and implications for review/ratings inflation are discussed.",19

","Purpose 
 
 
 
 
Recommender systems collect information about users and businesses and how they are related. Such relation is given in terms of reviews and votes on reviews. User reviews gather opinions, rating scores and review influence. The latter component is crucial for determining which users are more relevant in a recommender system, that is, the users whose reviews are more popular than the average user’s reviews. 
 
 
 
 
Design/methodology/approach 
 
 
 
 
A model of measure of user influence is proposed based on review and social attributes of the user. User influence is also used for determining how influenced has been a business being based on popular reviews. 
 
 
 
 
Findings 
 
 
 
 
Results indicate there is a connection between social attributes and user influence. Such results are relevant for marketing, credibility estimation and Sybil detections, among others. 
 
 
 
 
Originality/value 
 
 
 
 
The proposed model allows search parameterization based on the social attribute weights of users, reviews and businesses. Such weights defines the relevance on each attribute, which can be adjusted according to the search needs. Popularity results are then a function of weight preferences on user, reviews and businesses data join.",10

","Many AI systems have a black box nature that makes it difficult to understand how they make their recommendations. This can be unsettling, as the designer cannot be certain how the system will respond to novelty. To penetrate our Na\""ive Bayes recommender's black box, we first asked, what do we want to know from our system, and how can it be obtained? The answers led us to recursively define a common lexicon with the AI, a lingua franca, using the very items that the system ranks to create meta-symbols recognized by the system, and enabling us to understand the system's knowledge in plain terms and at different levels of abstraction. As one bonus, using its existing knowledge, the lingua franca can enable the system to extend recommendations to related, but entirely new areas, ameliorating the cold start problem. We also supplement the lingua franca with techniques for visualizing the system's knowledge state, develop metrics for evaluating the meaningfulness of terms in the lingua franca, and generalize the requirements for developing a similar lingua franca in other applications.",7

In the current study, we aim to build a recommendation system for businesses to provide suggestions for business collaboration. Based on historical data from Yelp that shows two businesses being reviewed by the same users within a same season, we were able to identify businesses that might attract the same customers in the future, and hence provide them with a collaboration suggestion.

","Personalisation of product and services is one of the most important aspects in e-commerce and web-based companies. Recommender system is the technology that helps build personalisation features. One promising and emerging area in the field of recommender systems is explanations. Explanation is the reasoning behind the information presented about a recommendation and plays an important role in helping the user evaluate the recommendation received on websites related to e-commerce, social networking, search engines, etc. In this paper, we present an overview of this emerging concept of explanation which is important in present day context as an aid for overcoming information overload. Present status of research in this field is discussed on the three important areas-objectives and evaluation of performance of explanations, effect of explanation interfaces on the users and the growing influence of explanations in social networking sites. We conclude the paper with discussions on areas of future research in this upcoming field which can be of academic interest to the researchers and of practical utility to the system designers of recommender systems for increasing its effectiveness.",19

","Digital Signage (DS) is one of the popular IoT technologies deployed in the urban space. DS can provide wayfinding and urban information to city dwellers and convey targeted messaging and advertising to people approaching the DS. With the rise of the online-to-offline (O2O) mobile commerce, DS also become an important marketing tool in urban retailing. However, most digital signage systems today lack interactive feature and context-aware recommendation engine. Few interactive digital signage systems available today are also insufficient in engaging anonymous viewers and also not considering temporal interaction between viewer and DS system. To overcome the above challenges, this paper proposes a context-aware recommender system framework with novel temporal interaction scheme for IoT based interactive digital signage deployed in urban space to engage anonymous viewer. The results of experiments indicate that the proposed framework improves the advertising effectiveness for DS system deployed in public in urban space.",8

","This paper describes the overview of recommendation system. The recommendation system is the sub-part of the data mining field. This is the era of the e-commerce business. Recommender systems are used to assists the enterprise to implement one-to-one marketing strategies. These type of strategies offer several advantages like establishing the customer loyalty, increase the probability of cross-selling, fulfilling the customer need by presenting the items or products of customer interest. The recommendation system (RS) is crucial in many applications on the web. The recommendation system is mainly classified into following three categories: content-based, collaborative-based and hybrid approaches. Different categories have its own advantages as well as disadvantages .This paper describes the different techniques in each category and the issues in each category.",11

","In the marketing domain, models of grocery buying behavior consider purchase incidence as a key dimension. However, in recommender systems, timing is often subsumed under contextual information and has received little attention yet. For this reason, we analyze the relation between the timing of a recommendation and its acceptance across different product categories. Our study is based on a real-world deployment of an in-store recommendation system in the brick-and-mortar grocery industry. We base our analysis on transaction data of more than 100,000 unique users and more than four million product recommendations. Our findings suggest that the success of a recommendation significantly depends on the inter-purchase time within the respective category. Different sensitivities across product categories further stress the importance of timing and its interplay with category characteristics within the context of recommender systems. The insights gained in this study enable retailers to improve scheduling recommendations and target promotions more efficiently.",19

","Mobile smartphone applications can be used to provide users with suitable location-based product or service recommendations. Recent developments of micro-location based recommender systems take the customers’ in-store location into account and try to provoke immediate purchases decisions in close proximity to the actual product. Furthermore, an increasing number of mobile retailing apps allow to make purchases online using the phone itself as the point-of-sale (POS) and thus making the existence of a physical POS obsolete. However, such online retailing applications do not leverage the customers’ micro location. As people spend most of their free time at home we will implement a micro-location based recommender system in the Smart Home context. We suggest a novel approach of mapping rooms in a customers’ apartment to departments in a retail store, thereby transferring the idea of in-store marketing to in-home marketing. As a result we construct an improved recommender system for (1) micro-location based in-home marketing and (2) interest-based marketing based on customers’ domestic room preferences.",42

","Automated recommender systems have played a more and more important role in marketing and ever increasingly booming e-commerce systems. They provide useful predictions personalized recommendations according to customers’ characteristics and a variety of large and complex product offerings. In many of these recommendation technologies C ollaborative Filtering (CF) has proven to be one of the most successful recommendation method, which has been widely used in many e-commerce systems. The success of CF recommendation depends mainly on locating similar neighbors to get recommendation items. However, many scholars have found that the process of finding similar neighbors often fail, due to some inherent weaknesses of CF based recommendation. In view of this, we propose a trust feedback recommendation algorithm based on directed trust graph (DTG), which is able to propagate trust relationship. In our approach, there is no need to compute similarity between users, but utilize the trust relation between them to conduct prediction calculation. Based on the analysis of human trust perception, we incorporate the process into our recommendation algorithm. Experimental evaluation on r eal life Epinions datasets shows that the effectiveness and practicability of our approach.",11

","Abstract As recommender systems have proven their usefulness in e-commerce by providing personalised recommendations, the approach is to be transferred to medicine. Particularly, the diagnoses made by physicians in rural hospitals of developing countries, in remote areas or in situations of uncertainty are to be complemented by machine recommendations drawing on large bases of expert knowledge to reduce the risk to patients. To this end, a database of patients' medical history and a cluster model is maintained centrally. The model is constructed incrementally by a combination of collaborative and knowledge-based filtering, in the course of which it permanently widens its knowledge base on a medical area given. To give a recommendation, the model's cluster matching the diagnostic pattern of a considered patient best is sought. The therapy actually applied after the recommendation and its subsequently observed consequences are fed back for model updating. Readily available personal digital accessories can be used for remote data entry and recommendation display as well as for communication with the central site. The approach is validated in the area of obstetrics and gynecology using data on cephalopelvic disproportion.",19

","Recent explosive increase of electronic commerce provides many advantageous purchase opportunities to customers. In this situation, customers who do not have enough knowledge about their purchases, may accept product recommendations. Product recommender systems automatically reflect user`s preference and provide recommendation list to the users. Thus, product recommender system in online shopping store has been known as one of the most popular tools for one-to-one marketing. However, recommender systems which do not properly reflect user`s preference cause user`s disappointment and waste of time. In this study, we propose a novel recommender system which uses data mining and multi-model ensemble techniques to enhance the recommendation performance through reflecting the precise user`s preference. The research data is collected from the real-world online shopping store, which deals products from famous art galleries and museums in Korea. The data initially contain 5759 transaction data, but finally remain 3167 transaction data after deletion of null data. In this study, we transform the categorical variables into dummy variables and exclude outlier data. The proposed model consists of two steps. The first step predicts customers who have high likelihood to purchase products in the online shopping store. In this step, we first use logistic regression, decision trees, and artificial neural networks to predict customers who have high likelihood to purchase products in each product group. We perform above data mining techniques using SAS E-Miner software. In this study, we partition datasets into two sets as modeling and validation sets for the logistic regression and decision trees. We also partition datasets into three sets as training, test, and validation sets for the artificial neural network model. The validation dataset is equal for the all experiments. Then we composite the results of each predictor using the multi-model ensemble techniques such as bagging and bumping. Bagging is the abbreviation of ""Bootstrap Aggregation"" and it composite outputs from several machine learning techniques for raising the performance and stability of prediction or classification. This technique is special form of the averaging method. Bumping is the abbreviation of ""Bootstrap Umbrella of Model Parameter,"" and it only considers the model which has the lowest error value. The results show that bumping outperforms bagging and the other predictors except for ""Poster"" product group. For the ""Poster"" product group, artificial neural network model performs better than the other models. In the second step, we use the market basket analysis to extract association rules for co-purchased products. We can extract thirty one association rules according to values of Lift, Support, and Confidence measure. We set the minimum transaction frequency to support associations as 5%, maximum number of items in an association as 4, and minimum confidence for rule generation as 10%. This study also excludes the extracted association rules below 1 of lift value. We finally get fifteen association rules by excluding duplicate rules. Among the fifteen association rules, eleven rules contain association between products in ""Office Supplies"" product group, one rules include the association between ""Office Supplies"" and ""Fashion"" product groups, and other three rules contain association between ""Office Supplies"" and ""Home Decoration"" product groups. Finally, the proposed product recommender systems provides list of recommendations to the proper customers. We test the usability of the proposed system by using prototype and real-world transaction and profile data. For this end, we construct the prototype system by using the ASP, Java Script and Microsoft Access. In addition, we survey about user satisfaction for the recommended product list from the proposed system and the randomly selected product lists. The participants for the survey are 173 persons who use MSN Messenger, Daum Caf, and P2P services. We evaluate the user satisfaction using five-scale Likert measure. This study also performs ""Paired Sample T-test"" for the results of the survey. The results show that the proposed model outperforms the random selection model with 1% statistical significance level. It means that the users satisfied the recommended product list significantly. The results also show that the proposed system may be useful in real-world online shopping store.",19

","Recommender Systems are effective methods that have been developed successfully in e-commerce to provide personal recommendations based on user’s previous preferences. A recommender system assists users in a decision-making process to suggest interesting items from overwhelming flood of data available in the system. Suitably adapting the technology, recommender systems for medical purposes have been presented in some researches, which are applied in medical care or diagnosis called Medical Recommender Systems. They are intelligent methods that originally contain the medical knowledge from both historical data and example cases, as well as utilized for Telemedicine. Moreover, to maximize the effectiveness and quality of medical services, not only medical knowledge but also available external evidences named “Evidence-based Medicine” should be considered together. Therefore, this paper proposes Medical Recommender Systems combined with Evidence-based Medicine, which is called “Evidence-based Medical Recommender Systems”.",19

Given such demand, developing and improving automated computational recommendation systems is a constant priority. The RecSys2013: Yelp Business Rating Prediction contest exemplifies one idea of such a recommender system – it requires an algorithm that will make high-quality predictions about a collection of specific user and business pairs. We use common existing recommender systems, such as nearest neighbor predictions, weighted averages, matrix factorization, and clustering, further customizing these traditional methodologies to include the distinct features unique to the Yelp data set, such as number of check-ins, user gender, and review counts.

","The competition among manufacturers and service providing companies as well as the widespread presence of electronic processes has introduced new business models that need special e-Marketing. Social network marketing is one of the most recent types of marketing. Today, due to their flexibility and ease of use, social networks have fallen in the center of attention for users of various age groups. The variety of online social network groups, some of which are created with commercial goals, has made users uncertain and skeptical; on the other hand, in todayâ€™s competitive market, companies are seeking their potential and actual customers. To solve this problem, this paper introduced a group recommender system which, using data mining techniques and information theory, offers customized recommendations based on user preferences. Supposing that users in each group share similar characteristics, heterogeneous members are identified and removed. Unlike other methods, in special cases where the user does not have relationships with other members or when an activity history for the user does not exist, this method could yet offer recommendations.",31

","In this work, we present a proactive content based recommender system that employs web document clustering performed by using eye gaze data. Generally, recommender systems are used in commercial applications, where information about the user's habits and interests are of crucial importance in order to plan marketing strategies, or in information retrieval systems in order to suggest similar resources a user is interested in. Commonly, these systems use explicit relevance feedback techniques (e.g. mouse or keyboard) to improve their performance and to recommend products. In contrast, the proposed system permits to capture user's interest by using implicit relevance feedback, based on data acquired by an eye tracker Tobii T60. The purpose of the system is to collect eye gaze data during web navigation and, by employing clustering techniques, to suggest web documents similar to those that the user, implicitly, expressed greater interest. Performance evaluation was carried out on 30 users and the results show that the proposed system enhanced navigation experience in about 73% of the cases.",7

","Consumer consumption patterns are shifting rapidly as buyers migrate from offline markets to e-commerce routes, such as shopping channels on TV and internet shopping malls. In the offline markets consumers go shopping, see the shopping items, and choose from them. Recently consumers tend towards buying at shopping sites free from time and place. However, as e-commerce markets continue to expand, customers are complaining that it is becoming a bigger hassle to shop online. In the online shopping, shoppers have very limited information on the products. The delivered products can be different from what they have wanted. This case results to purchase cancellation. Because these things happen frequently, they are likely to refer to the consumer reviews and companies should be concerned about consumer's voice. E-commerce is a very important marketing tool for suppliers. It can recommend products to customers and connect them directly with suppliers with just a click of a button. The recommender system is being studied in various ways. Some of the more prominent ones include recommendation based on best-seller and demographics, contents filtering, and collaborative filtering. However, these systems all share two weaknesses : they cannot recommend products to consumers on a personal level, and they cannot recommend products to new consumers with no buying history. To fix these problems, we can use the information which has been collected from the questionnaires about their demographics and preference ratings. But, consumers feel these questionnaires are a burden and are unlikely to provide correct information. This study investigates combining collaborative filtering with the centrality of social network analysis. This centrality measure provides the information to infer the preference of new consumers from the shopping history of existing and previous ones. While the past researches had focused on the existing consumers with similar shopping patterns, this study tried to improve the accuracy of recommendation with all shopping information, which included not only similar shopping patterns but also dissimilar ones. Data used in this study, Movie Lens' data, was made by Group Lens research Project Team at University of Minnesota to recommend movies with a collaborative filtering technique. This data was built from the questionnaires of 943 respondents which gave the information on the preference ratings on 1,684 movies. Total data of 100,000 was organized by time, with initial data of 50,000 being existing customers and the latter 50,000 being new customers. The proposed recommender system consists of three systems : [+] group recommender system, [-] group recommender system, and integrated recommender system. [+] group recommender system looks at customers with similar buying patterns as 'neighbors', whereas [-] group recommender system looks at customers with opposite buying patterns as 'contraries'. Integrated recommender system uses both of the aforementioned recommender systems to recommend movies that both recommender systems pick. The study of three systems allows us to find the most suitable recommender system that will optimize accuracy and customer satisfaction. Our analysis showed that integrated recommender system is the best solution among the three systems studied, followed by [-] group recommended system and [+] group recommender system. This result conforms to the intuition that the accuracy of recommendation can be improved using all the relevant information. We provided contour maps and graphs to easily compare the accuracy of each recommender system. Although we saw improvement on accuracy with the integrated recommender system, we must remember that this research is based on static data with no live customers. In other words, consumers did not see the movies actually recommended from the system. Also, this recommendation system may not work well with products other than movies. Thus, it is important to note that recommendation systems need particular calibration for specific product/customer types.",31

","Nowadays, recommender systems are considered to be a valuable tool for internet marketing. Multi-criteria user modelling methodologies have been successfully applied to increase recommender systems accuracy. However, modelling user behaviour can be hard and often misleading when only the overall preference rate is considered. Various multi-criteria recommendation algorithms have been proposed that try to achieve high recommendation scores, but the gap from research ideas to real life applications remain large. Hence, studies concerning the understanding and interpretation of theoretical results together with direct application in real user data will improve and establish multi-criteria user profiling techniques as an important tool for recommender systems. In this direction, we analyse movie user profiles as a result of a multi-criteria recommendation methodology, applied to real user data, in order to reveal any hidden aspect of user behaviour that would eventually improve current system’s performance.",19

","For large software projects, system designers have to adhere to a significant number of functional and non-functional requirements, which makes software development a complex engineering task. If these requirements change during the development process, complexity even increases. In this paper, we suggest recommendation systems based on context-aware composition to enable a system designer to postpone and automate decisions regarding efficiency non-functional requirements, such as performance, and focus on the design of the core functionality of the system instead. Context-aware composition suggests the optimal component variants of a system for different static contexts (e.g., software and hardware environment) or even different dynamic contexts (e.g., actual parameters and resource utilization). Thus, an efficiency non-functional requirement can be automatically optimized statically or dynamically by providing possible component variants. Such a recommender system reduces time and effort spent on manually developing optimal applications that adapts to different (static or dynamic) contexts and even changes thereof.",1

","Customer churn may be a critical issue for banks. The extant literature on statistical and machine learning for customer churn focuses on the problem of correctly predicting that a customer is about to switch bank, while very rarely consid-ers the problem of generating personalized actions to improve the customer retention rate. However, these decisions are at least as critical as the correct identification of customers at risk. The decision of what actions to deliver to what customers is normally left to managers who can only rely upon their knowledge. By looking at the scientific literature on CRM and personalization, this research proposes a number of models which can be used to generate marketing ac-tions, and shows how to integrate them into a model embracing both the analytical prediction of customer churn and the generation of retention actions. The benefits and risks associated with each approach are discussed. The paper also describes a case of application of a predictive model of customer churn in a retail bank where the analysts have also generated a set of personalized actions to retain customers by using one of the approaches presented in the paper, namely by adapting a recommender system approach to the retention problem.",22

","Recommender systems are often used in electronic shops in order to suggest similar or related products, potentially interesting products for a given customer or a set of products for a marketing campaign. Most recommender systems use the collaborative filtering method in order to provide the personalization information. The collaborative filtering method is a very efficient and convenient way of achieving personalization as there is no need to introduce semantic information about the products or to manually link products and users together. In the last years, a number of optimizations for collaborative filtering techniques have been developed. This paper collects the ideas and shows which of them could be integrated successfully in order to optimize a collaborative recommender system for online shops.",19

","The content that a recommender system (RS) shows to users inﬂuences them. Therefore, when choosing a recommender to deploy, one is implicitly also choosing to induce speciﬁc internal states in users. Even more, systems trained via long-horizon optimization will have direct incentives to manipulate users: in this work, we focus on the incentive to shift user preferences so they are easier to satisfy. We argue that – before deployment – system designers should: estimate the shifts a recommender would induce; evaluate whether such shifts would be undesirable; and perhaps even actively optimize to avoid problematic shifts. These steps involve two challenging ingredients: estimation requires anticipating how hypothetical algorithms would inﬂuence user preferences if deployed – we do this by using historical user interaction data to train a predictive user model which implicitly contains their preference dynamics; evaluation and optimization additionally require metrics to assess whether such inﬂuences are manipulative or otherwise unwanted – we use the notion of “safe shifts”, that deﬁne a trust region within which behavior is safe: for instance, the natural way in which users would shift without interference from the system could be deemed “safe”. In simulated experiments, we show that our learned preference dynamics model is effective in estimating user preferences and how they would respond to new recommenders. Additionally, we show that recommenders that optimize for staying in the trust region can avoid manipulative behaviors while still generating engagement.",19

","From e-commerce websites to social media, Consumers produce a massive volume of product-related reviews, which has a significant potential for commercial business value of marketing objectives. In particular, the online customer reviews can have an impact on the brand image and position. In this context, sentiment analysis (SA) has been used in a recent trend of study to investigate the text reviews and classify customer opinions. Customer reviews may contain sentiment words with varying polarities. The user may have differing feelings about different features of the product, Product managers can be interested in determining customers opinion about each feature of a product for brand management. In this paper, the main contribution is the implementation of an automatic recommender system based on different levels of sentiment analysis using hybrid deep learning methods to identify the polarity-based sentiment features to calculate the sentiment score of a product. The review sentiment score and aspect-level sentiment scores are combined with price and star score to determine the global score of a product. which enable us to rank the products based on their positive features using visualization approaches such as dashboards, assisting marketing persons and customers in their decision-making process. We proved the validity of our approach using customer review (specifically smart phones), extracted from various e-commerce websites attaining acceptable and promising results. Finally, the proposed method for sentiment analysis of customer review and ranking scores are able to improve the progress of recommender systems.",32

","Recommender systems is one of the major technical research tracks in the internet and big data era. However, in many small or medium-sized corporations that lack big data, sparsity is a frequently encountered problem in real world context settings. The sparsity problem also poses problems to recommender system designers during the initial stage after the system is put online. In spite of the criticality of the sparsity problem, the research and investigation on sparsity problem has been slim in the research community. In this paper, we propose to use ZeroMat (invented in 2021) as the preprocessing step before recommender system execution to solve the sparsity problem. We prove by experiments our hybrid method outperforms single models such as ZeroMat and the classic version of Matrix Factorization.",7

","Online transactions are significant in the pandemic era. Using online transactions can minimize the risk of physical contact with disease transmission between buyers and sellers. However, with so many choices of items, it becomes challenging for users to decide which item suits their needs. For this reason, the recommender system was created as a handy tool. Recommender systems can help provide ratings, compare with other user data, use personal transaction history, use current events, or combine the above methods. Currently, computer science experts are constantly trying to improve recommender systems. In 2017 a new method emerged that uses transformers as one of the deep learning models. The combination of recommender systems and transformers can process extensive data, create different weights for each input data, and process data without sequentially allowing parallel processing and reducing training time significantly. Many papers in various countries are continuously trying to improve this methodology. In this literature review, we try to analyze the technology used, the dataset used, and the area where the technology is implemented. In this case, we carry out collecting papers, then filtering, classifying and analyzing, and making conclusions.",35

For traditional recommendation algorithms, how to extract effective features to solve the problem of data sparsity has always been a hot research direction in the field of recommendation systems. In view of the above-mentioned problems, this paper proposes a recommender based on enhanced collaborative filtering algorithm for 5G marketing system. Specifically, by broadening the input vector field and fusing the user's social information and personal interaction information, the problem of multisource information collaborative modeling is effectively solved. Further, in order to achieve the enhancement of vector structure, we introduce a social regularization term and an internal regularization term to alleviate the overfitting problem of most recommendation algorithms.

","Recommender systems (RS) have started to employ knowledge distillation, which is a model compression technique training a compact model (student) with the knowledge transferred from a cumbersome model (teacher). The state-of-the-art methods rely on unidirectional distillation transferring the knowledge only from the teacher to the student, with an underlying assumption that the teacher is always superior to the student. However, we demonstrate that the student performs better than the teacher on a significant proportion of the test set, especially for RS. Based on this observation, we propose Bidirectional Distillation (BD) framework whereby both the teacher and the student collaboratively improve with each other. Specifically, each model is trained with the distillation loss that makes to follow the other’s prediction along with its original loss function. For effective bidirectional distillation, we propose rank discrepancy-aware sampling scheme to distill only the informative knowledge that can fully enhance each other. The proposed scheme is designed to effectively cope with a large performance gap between the teacher and the student. Trained in the bidirectional way, it turns out that both the teacher and the student are significantly improved compared to when being trained separately. Our extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that our proposed framework consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art competitors.

","Recommender Systems (RS) have employed knowledge distillation which is a model compression technique training a compact student model with the knowledge transferred from a pre-trained large teacher model. Recent work has shown that transferring knowledge from the teacher's intermediate layer significantly improves the recommendation quality of the student. However, they transfer the knowledge of individual representation point-wise and thus have a limitation in that primary information of RS lies in the relations in the representation space. This paper proposes a new topology distillation approach that guides the student by transferring the topological structure built upon the relations in the teacher space. We first observe that simply making the student learn the whole topological structure is not always effective and even degrades the student's performance. We demonstrate that because the capacity of the student is highly limited compared to that of the teacher, learning the whole topological structure is daunting for the student. To address this issue, we propose a novel method named Hierarchical Topology Distillation (HTD) which distills the topology hierarchically to cope with the large capacity gap. Our extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that the proposed method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art competitors. We also provide in-depth analyses to ascertain the benefit of distilling the topology for RS.",30

","With the recent advances of conversational recommendations, the recommender system is able to actively and dynamically elicit user preference via conversational interactions. To achieve this, the system periodically queries users' preference on attributes and collects their feedback. However, most existing conversational recommender systems only enable the user to provide absolute feedback to the attributes. In practice, the absolute feedback is usually limited, as the users tend to provide biased feedback when expressing the preference. Instead, the user is often more inclined to express comparative preferences, since user preferences are inherently relative. To enable users to provide comparative preferences during conversational interactions, we propose a novel comparison-based conversational recommender system. The relative feedback, though more practical, is not easy to be incorporated since its feedback scale is always mismatched with users' absolute preferences. With effectively collecting and understanding the relative feedback from an interactive manner, we further propose a new bandit algorithm, which we call RelativeConUCB. The experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets validate the advantage of our proposed method, compared to the existing bandit algorithms in the conversational recommender systems.",41

","Graph learning is an emerging technique widely used in diverse applications such as recommender system and medicine design. Real-world graph learning applications typically operate on large attributed graphs with rich information, which do not fit in the memory. Consequently, the graph learning requests have to go across the deep I/O stack and move massive data from storage to host memory, which incurs considerable latency and power consumption. To address this problem, we developed GLIST, an efficient in-storage graph learning system, to process graph learning requests inside SSDs. It has a customized graph learning accelerator implemented in the storage and enables the storage to directly respond to the graph learning requests. Thus, GLIST greatly reduces the data movement overhead in contrast to conventional GPGPU based systems. In addition, GLIST offers a set of high-level graph learning APIs and allows developers to deploy their graph learning service conveniently. Experimental results on an FPGA-based prototype show that GLIST achieves 13.2× and 10.1× average speedup and reduces the power consumption by up to 98.7% and 98.0% respectively on a series of graph learning tasks when compared to CPU and GPU based solutions.",32

","In this paper, we consider the task of ranking individuals based on the potential benefit of being ""treated"" (e.g. by a drug or exposure to recommendations or ads), referred to as Uplift Modeling in the literature. This application has gained a surge of interest in recent years and it is found in many applications such as personalized medicine, recommender systems or targeted advertising. In real life scenarios the capacity of models to rank individuals by potential benefit is measured by the Area Under the Uplift Curve (AUUC), a ranking metric related to the well known Area Under ROC Curve. In the case where the objective function, for learning model parameters, is different from AUUC, the capacity of the resulting system to generalize on AUUC is limited. To tackle this issue, we propose to learn a model that directly optimizes an upper bound on AUUC. To find such a model we first develop a generalization bound on AUUC and then derive from it a learning objective called AUUC-max, usable with linear and deep models. We empirically study the tightness of this generalization bound, its effectiveness for hyperparameters tuning and show the efficiency of the proposed learning objective compared to a wide range of competitive baselines on two classical uplift modeling benchmarks using real-world datasets.",27

","Video advertisements became very popular in recent past due to the technology advancement and competitiveness of businesses. Therefore, analyzing the impact of commercial video advertisements are important before they launch the marketing campaign. This paper presents a unique method that can evaluate the effectiveness of movie commercials (trailers) using Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals captured from a brain computer interface. Randomly selected fifteen movie lovers were participated to capture EEG signals. For a selected set of movie trailers, three different type of classification models were trained and tested. With the help of classification models, it measures attention and enjoyment levels and also emotion status of a viewer to compute effectiveness of an advertisement. It also consists of a recommender system which suggests movie advertisements based on the preferences of the users. From the initial results received, it confirms that proposed framework is producing promising results. Even though this work focuses on the movie/entertainment industry, it has the potential to be developed and applied for many other industries as well.",27

","Modern recommender systems are optimised to deliver personalised recommendations to millions of users spread across different geographic regions exhibiting various forms of heterogeneity, including behavioural-, content- and trend specific heterogeneity. System designers often face the challenge of deploying either a single global model across all markets, or developing custom models for different markets. In this work, we focus on the specific case of music recommendation across 21 different markets, and consider the trade-off between developing global model versus market specific models. We begin by investigating behavioural differences across users of different markets, and motivate the need for considering market as an important factor when training models. We propose five different training styles, covering the entire spectrum of models: from a single global model to individual market specific models, and in the process, propose ways to identify and leverage users abroad, and data from similar markets. Based on a large scale experimentation with data for 100M users across 21 different markets, we present insights which highlight that markets play a key role, and describe models that leverage market specific data in serving personalised recommendations.",19

","Recommender models for personalized marketing empower businesses to provide personalized recommendations of goods or services to customers to fulfil their requirements, thus ultimately improves the customer buying experience. Various recommender models powered by robust machine learning algorithms were reviewed on the methods and techniques to appraise its performance concerning the personalized marketing campaigns. Recommender models can be broadly categorized into four types such as content-based, collaborative-based, knowledge-based and hybrid-based. The content-based recommendation is suitable when the system, user or product is new where classification and regression algorithms are mostly implemented. The collaborative-based recommendation is suitable when a more accurate prediction is required where Neighbour-based models, Bayesian methods, rule-based models, decision trees, and latent matrix factorization models may be implemented in this scenario. Knowledge-based recommenders are well suited for recommendations that address explicitly defined user requirements. Different types of recommenders use different sources of data and inherently have different strengths and weaknesses. Selecting the suitable recommender model with the consideration of the scenario and domain of application is very crucial. Therefore, an in-depth research is required and done on the emphasis of the application of recommender models in the personalized marketing especially on the hybrid models with a more efficient deployment for mass applications in this contemporary data-driven business world.",16

","With the ever-growing volume of online information, recommender systems have been an effective strategy to overcome such information overload. The utility of recommender systems cannot be overstated, given its widespread adoption in many web applications, along with its potential impact to ameliorate many problems related to over-choice. Nowadays, people from all around the world use social media sites to share information. Twitter, for example, is a social network in which users send, read posts known as ‘tweets’ and interact with different communities. Users share their daily lives, post their opinions on everything such as brands and places. Social influence plays an important role in product marketing. However, it has rarely been considered in traditional recommender systems. In this paper, we present a new paradigm of e-commerce recommender systems, which can utilize information in social networks. In this study, we have combined sentiment analysis of twitter data with the collaborative filtering in order to increase system accuracy. The proposed system uses lexical approach to analyze sentiment. In order to design the recommender system, we have replaced the missing values of the ratings matrix with the averages of the ratings assigned to the items, to solve the sparsity and cold-start problems inherent in collaborative filtering. The results show that our proposed method improves CF performance. In this experiment we demonstrate how relevant social media can be for recommender systems.",10

","Design elements of serious game recommender system is a web-based software to propose design elements of serious game to the system users. Design elements of serious game are components that required to design serious game such as features and game mechanics. The research about recommender system for design elements of serious game is a relatively new research in serious game domain because research about recommendation system mainly for game players not for game designers. Many things need to be considered by serious game developer to make a game which can help the players to learn something. The recommender system helped serious game developers to determine the design elements of the game from the learning content to make the game. The domain data are analyzed from the relationship of Bloom Digital Taxonomy with game genres and game mechanism. The system is developed using knowledge-based: case and constraint-based filtering. Case-based filtering is used to find similar serious game examples from the user input of learning goal, target rating, and target player. Constraint-based filtering is used to search recommendation from the knowledge base. To get recommendation from the recommender system, user need to input learning goal to the system, and the results are recommendation of serious game mechanics and features. The level of success of the recommendation system is measured by input some constraints into the system and match the constraints with the result of recommendation produced by the system. Furthermore, crosscheck of the system functionalities was done to evaluate the system.

The most of popular recommender system adopted for many large e-commerce companies named Collaborative ﬁltering (CF) due to obtain relevant, ﬁt and essential product information. Even though CF owned some beneﬁt, it has shortcom-ing inaccurate recommendation when face minimum rating also popular named sparse data problem. Many researches have been conducted to proposed model how to generate rating prediction aim to handle sparse rating effectively. Most of them exploit latent factor model or matrix factorization (MF) to handle this problem, unfortunately, this problem fails to handle the problem when faced serious sparse data. Aims to improve the serious problem on above, several researchers involve auxiliary information in the form of product document or user demographic information respectively. Several researchers implemented Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to extract product document review incorporate MF that responsible to produce rating prediction, another model exploited Stack Denoising Auto Encoder (SDAE) model as user demographic information extraction incorporate with MF. In this research, considered implementing dual information representation using deep learning model based on SDAE and Long Shorts Term Memory (LSTM) as product review document representation combined into PMF to generate rating prediction.

","Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) like those conducted by the FDA provide medical practitioners with average effects of treatments, and are generally more desirable than observational studies due to their control of unobserved confounders (UCs), viz., latent factors that influence both treatment and recovery. However, recent results from causal inference have shown that randomization results in a subsequent loss of information about the UCs, which may impede treatment efficacy if left uncontrolled in practice (Bareinboim, Forney, and Pearl 2015). Our paper presents a novel experimental design that can be noninvasively layered atop past and future RCTs to not only expose the presence of UCs in a system, but also reveal patient- and practitioner-specific treatment effects in order to improve decision-making.

","Recommender systems have been extensively used by the entertainment industry, business marketing and the biomedical industry. In addition to its capacity of providing preference-based recommendations as an unsupervised learning methodology, it has been also proven useful in sales forecasting, product introduction and other production related businesses. Since some consumers and companies need a recommendation or prediction for future budget, labor and supply chain coordination, dynamic recommender systems for precise forecasting have become extremely necessary. In this article, we propose a new recommendation method, namely the dynamic tensor recommender system (DTRS), which aims particularly at forecasting future recommendation. The proposed method utilizes a tensor-valued function of time to integrate time and contextual information, and creates a time-varying coefficient model for temporal tensor factorization through a polynomial spline approximation. Major advantages of the proposed method include competitive future recommendation predictions and effective prediction interval estimations. In theory, we establish the convergence rate of the proposed tensor factorization and asymptotic normality of the spline coefficient estimator. The proposed method is applied to simulations and IRI marketing data. Numerical studies demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing methods in terms of future time forecasting.",7

","Online shopping also popular named e-commerce business need a computer machine to provide product information for customer or buyer candidate. Relevant information served by ecommerce system engine famous dubbed recommender system. It will impact seriously in increasing of marketing target achievement. The character of information in ecommerce have to be specific, personalized, relevant and fit according to customer profiling. There are four kind of recommender system to provide ecommerce recommender system, however only one model that most successful to applied in real ecommerce industry that namely collaborative filtering. These approaches rely on rating as basic calculation to generate product recommendation. However, just a little number of rating that given by customer reference to several convince datasets. The problem causes of sparse product rating, it will bring the impact to product recommendation accuracy. Sometime, in extreme condition impossible to generate product recommendation. Some work efforts have been developing to tackle lack of rating, one of them is considering to involving text sentences document such as text genre, product review, abstract, product description, synopsis, etc. All of material text sentences useful as raw component to predict the product rating.

","Due to the increasing popularity and easy accessibility of social networking services, the number of users in social networks is increasing rapidly. As a result, their size and user-generated content are growing day-to-day. One of the requirements is to capture such a huge amount of data and analyze them for desired purposes, such as target marketing, recommender system design, open-source intelligence, and cybersecurity. Twitter is one of the most popular social network sites (aka microblogging site) and it is used by almost every person for the news update, information sharing, viral marketing, etc using 280 characters. In this paper, we have applied a text analytics framework to analyze Twitter data at different levels of granularity. One of the distinguishing features of the proposed framework is to exploit both content and structural information for tweets analysis. The proposed framework first models the tweets into a multi-attributed graph, wherein tweets are rep-resented as nodes and inter-tweet relationships are represented as edges. For node labeling, we have used NLP techniques to identify features from tweets, whereas edges are labeled using meta-data (such as hashtags, mentions, followers, etc.) that are common to the tweets connected by the edges. For analyzing the multi-attributed graph, we have considered two algorithms, MAG-Dist and MAG-Sim, to convert the multi-attributed graph into a simple and similarity graph. Finally, we have applied MCL (Markov Clustering) algorithm to cluster the nodes of the multi-attributed graph, each group consisting of a particular subset of tweets representing an event. The experimental evaluation of the proposed approach is done on a real dataset crawled from Twitter.",16

","As with many other businesses, banking industry tends to digitalize its working processes and use state-of-the-art technique in the financial and commercial areas in its business. The main core of the bank business is managing communication with customers which eventually results in investment on customers. In this paper, the structure of a recommender system is described, whereby using the recommender technology the places for purchase in which so far, the customers have not used any special type of Bon cards but are probable to buy from them is estimated and proposed to the customers.Matrix factorization is a type of method for collaborative filtering based on models which is widely used for rating prediction concept. Generally, bank products are not rated by customers; these products are usually purchased or offered to customers by the bank. Therefore, to determine the rating, RFM 1 method which is an instrument for analysis in marketing is used along with clustering algorithm to determine the customer value and place. If a place does not have any value, i.e. the data have missing values, it suggests that we do not know whether the customer prefers the place for purchase or not. In this paper, a hybrid method based on dimension reduction technique is presented. This method is able to predict the missing values in data to offer recommendation to customers. Assessment of the proposed model through Root Mean Square Error 2 indicates that the architecture in this paper has less error in comparison to common collaborative filtering methods.",38

In contrast to most existing models that completely neglect user preferences, our approach allows us to model the most important source for movie success: moviegoer taste and behavior. We divide the problem into three distinct stages: (i) we use matrix factorization recommenders to model each user's taste, (ii) we then predict the individual consumption behavior, and (iii) eventually aggregate users to predict the box office result. We compare our approach to the current industry standard and show that the inclusion of user rating data reduces the error by a factor of 2x and outperforms recently published research.",0

However, users do not always provide details in their online profiles due to privacy concern. Most existing approaches can infer user private attributes based on sufficient interaction history but could fail for new users with few ratings. In this paper, we present a novel preference elicitation method, with which a recommender system asks cold-start users to rate selected items adaptively and infer the demographics rapidly via a few interactions. Specifically, latent user profiles are learned across the tasks of demographic inference and rating prediction simultaneously, which enables knowledge transfer through the two related tasks and improves the prediction accuracy for both tasks. The proposed method can also facilitate the understanding of the tradeoff between user privacy and the utility of personalization. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the performance of the proposed method in terms of the accuracy of both demographics inference and rating prediction.",19

","Business to Business (B2B) marketing aims at meeting the needs of other businesses instead of individual consumers. In B2B markets, the buying processes usually involve series of different marketing campaigns providing necessary information to multiple decision makers with different interests and motivations. The dynamic and complex nature of these processes imposes significant challenges to analyze the process logs for improving the B2B marketing practice. Indeed, most of the existing studies only focus on the individual consumers in the markets, such as movie/product recommender systems. In this paper, we exploit the temporal behavior patterns in the buying processes of the business customers and develop a B2B marketing campaign recommender system. Specifically, we first propose the temporal graph as the temporal knowledge representation of the buying process of each business customer. The key idea is to extract and integrate the campaign order preferences of the customer using the temporal graph. We then develop the low-rank graph reconstruction framework to identify the common graph patterns and predict the missing edges in the temporal graphs. We show that the prediction of the missing edges is effective to recommend the marketing campaigns to the business customers during their buying processes. Moreover, we also exploit the community relationships of the business customers to improve the performances of the graph edge predictions and the marketing campaign recommendations. Finally, we have performed extensive empirical studies on real-world B2B marketing data sets and the results show that the proposed method can effectively improve the quality of the campaign recommendations for challenging B2B marketing tasks.",53

","Social networking websites (SNS) are attaining a lot of recognition by researchers as they prove to be a reservoir of huge amount of data. These sites have revolutionized the world of technology by allowing their users to form a virtual world of their own. The main notion behind building the social networking websites is to bring people from all walks of life together, having some link with each other either on the base of their philosophies or ideas about life, or belonging to same occupational class, or sharing same thoughts and views, in a form of virtual community. SNSs provide a medium for people to remain in contact with their beloved ones, get global as well as local updates, and share their feelings with others. Additionally, these sites have also been used effectively for marketing and advertising almost every kind of products. Companies announce their pages while giving demonstrations of their items. Thus, SNS have basically emerged most common recommender engines. However, most of the times, unnecessary and irrelevant information are displayed on these social interaction pages which causes high data traffic and distract of user concentration. This issue becomes severe in case a user visits multiple social websites frequently. Thus, a personalized system is needed that could provide a single platform to make recommendations based on user's friends circle on different SNS sites. Different multi agent system architectures have been proposed to efficiently carryout different search and recommendation procedure but, little attention was given to the user interface. In this research, we solve this issue by the design and development of adaptable intelligent agent based interface. The objective is to intelligently present the personalize recommendations help a user to get what he needs from his social Web site in a blink of eye without wasting time in dealing with a complex search procedures.",7

We collected a set of tweets (around 500,000 tweets) that contain specific hash tags (#throwing up, #headache, #itching etc) for a three consecutive weeks. The individual tweets were examined manually by a domain expert (a medical doctor) who inspected the tweet sentiments along with the tweet's timestamp. Using this data, the domain expert assigned a preliminary label to the tweet/group of tweets. We then trained a classifier using the hash tags and its labels taking into consideration other factors (i.e., age, gender, co-morbidity conditions) that the Tweeter must provide by taking a questionnaire. After the questions are answered, the recommender system makes recommendations based on the Tweet contents and the questionnaire factors for never-seen-before tweets. The classifier, is the core component of the recommender system, is designed as a Decision Tree algorithm to classify the Tweets. Each recommendation is made by the system provides a medical advice to promote public health awareness, and a link to the recommender systems' web portal to answer the questionnaire.

","Often consumer's definition of design concepts conflicts with designer's idea, and this has always caused confusions. In the context of product emotion, this work strives to understand consumer's emotional responses towards designs, and investigate how differences of designs affect emotions. This paper reports work to explore potential to design a recommender system for children's clothing in Malaysia with the implementation of Kansei Engineering. In the system, the knowledge base is formed from the Kansei evaluation and analysis procedure that are anticipated to provide data such as the semantic Kansei, the design influence and the specimen's Kansei. The result shows that Malaysian's consumer's Kansei in children's clothing could be classified into forty clusters and the Kansei design could be structured by five concepts. Strong relations between Kansei and specimen could be determined, and design influence could be identified by Partial Least Square Analysis. Inference rules for the system are set to include age group, price range and occasion. With the result successfully obtained from Kansei evaluation and analysis, the paper proposes a recommender system that could be of importance to support the design process of children's clothing in Malaysia. The system could also be used to facilitate consumers in objectively describing their desired clothing design to designers as well as retailers to avoid misunderstanding.",2

","Rising costs in health care have encouraged individuals to become more aware of disease prevention. Therapy in the prevention of disease is very popular; this complementary and alternative medicine treatment is known as “wellness”. Wellness therapy is about balancing the harmony of body, mind and spirit, through physical beauty care, healthy diet, relaxation, environmental sensitivity and social contacts. However, in today's digital world, wellness information is not sufficient to meet the demands of users who tend to seek for wellness therapies suitable for themselves. Therefore, the wellness industry should provide effective solutions customised to an individual's needs and preferences. A study on enhancing the wellness recommendation services available on a wellness community portal was carried out to find the best technique(s) for matching users' wellness concerns with appropriate wellness therapy, and making reliable wellness recommendations based on individual preferences and wellness conditions. Hybrid case-based reasoning (HCBR) is the best approach for wellness therapy recommendation. HCBR uses three alternatives in suggesting solutions to users. The first alternative is to locate the same case in a case database to solve a user's current wellness concern. The second alternative is to match a user's wellness concerns with existing similar cases in a case database. The third alternative is to use a set of pre-determined standard rules in a rule-based reasoning (RBR) sub-system. The model proposed below will enhance users' knowledge and convenience in selecting suitable wellness therapy for their complementary and alternative medicine treatments.",10

So to automatically suggest the foods based on their health conditions and the level of sugar, blood pressure, protein, fat, cholesterol, age etc. the paper puts forth k-clique embedded deep learning classifier recommendation system for suggesting the diets for the patients. The K-clique incorporated in the recommendation system in an effort of getting an improved preciseness and increasing the accuracy of the deep learning classifier (gated recurrent units). The dataset for the empirical analysis of the developed system was performed with the data set of the patients collected over the internet as well as hospitals, information’s of about 50 patients were collected with thirteen features of various disease and thousand products with eight feature set. All these features were encoded and grouped into several clusters before applying into the deep learning classifiers.

The main issue of RSs is the presence of cold users which are less active and their preferences are more difficult to detect. The aim of this study is to provide a new way to improve recall and precision in recommender systems for cold users. According to the available categories of items, prioritization of the proposed items is improved and then presented to the cold user. The obtained results show that in addition to increased speed of processing, recall and precision have an acceptable improvement.",49

","Natural medicine is a system of therapy that administrates natural agents and their derivatives to treat human diseases. This medicine has been used to treat many kinds of human diseases for thousands of years. The treatment protocols of natural medicine are integrative in nature, and are required to utilize the most appropriate therapies to address the needs of the individual patient. Because of the relative convenience, safety and efficacy, natural medicine is now increasing worldwide. Naturopathic doctors are licensed in many areas of the world and regulated partly by law in these areas, which is quite different from various other forms of complementary and alternative medicine. Liver diseases, such as hepatitis, liver cirrhosis and liver carcinoma, are serious health problems worldwide. Nearly half of the natural agents used in treatment of liver diseases today are natural products and their derivatives. Although natural medicine is beneficial and safe, physicians should pay close attention to the potential side-effects of the naturopathic agents, which lead to liver injury, interstitial pneumonia and acute respiratory failure. Therefore, when administrating naturopathic protocols to patients for the treatment of liver diseases, we should try our best to prevent and avoid as much as possible the negative impact of these medicines. This article highlights the current practice and recommended improvement of natural medicines in the treatment of liver diseases and gives some specific examples to emphasize the prevention and management of adverse reactions of the natural agents and suggests that natural medicine should be cautiously used to treat liver problems.",35

","ABSTRACT In recent years, there has been a growing demand to develop efficient recommender systems which track users’ preferences and recommend potential items of interest to users. In this article, we propose a group-specific method to use dependency information from users and items which share similar characteristics under the singular value decomposition framework. The new approach is effective for the “cold-start” problem, where, in the testing set, majority responses are obtained from new users or for new items, and their preference information is not available from the training set. One advantage of the proposed model is that we are able to incorporate information from the missing mechanism and group-specific features through clustering based on the numbers of ratings from each user and other variables associated with missing patterns. In addition, since this type of data involves large-scale customer records, traditional algorithms are not computationally scalable. To implement the proposed method, we propose a new algorithm that embeds a back-fitting algorithm into alternating least squares, which avoids large matrices operation and big memory storage, and therefore makes it feasible to achieve scalable computing. Our simulation studies and MovieLens data analysis both indicate that the proposed group-specific method improves prediction accuracy significantly compared to existing competitive recommender system approaches. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.",33

","The problem of hyper-local place ranking. Given a user location and query string (e.g., “Indian restaurant""), hyper-local ranking provides a list of top-k points of interest influenced by previously logged directional queries (e.g., map direction searches from point A to point B).This paper proposes LARS*, a location-aware recommender system that uses their location-based ratings to show recommendations. Traditional recommender systems do not have spatial properties of users nor items; LARS*, next, supports a taxonomy of three novel classes of location-based ratings, namely, spatial ratings for non-spatial items, non-spatial ratings for spatial items, and spatial ratings for spatial items. LARS* exploits user rating locations through user partitioning, a technique that influences recommendations with ratings spatially close to querying users in a manner that maximizes system scalability while not sacrificing recommendation quality. LARS* exploits item locations using travel penalty, a technique that favors recommendation candidates closer in travel distance to querying users in a way that avoids exhaustive access to all spatial items. LARS* can apply these techniques separately, or together, depending on the type of location-based rating available. Experimental evidence using large-scale real-world data from both the Foursquare location-based social network and the Movie Lens movie recommendation system reveals that LARS* is efficient, scalable, and capable of producing recommendations twice as accurate compared to existing recommendation approaches. Our proposed location-aware recommender system, tackles a problem untouched by traditional recommender systems by dealing with three types of location-based ratings: spatial ratings for non-spatial items, non-spatial ratings for spatial items, and spatial ratings for spatial items. LARS* employs user partitioning and travel penalty techniques to support spatial ratings and spatial items, respectively.",40

","This paper studies the design of a recommender system for organizing social learning on a product. To improve incentives for early experimentation, the optimal design trades off fully transparent social learning by over-recommending a product (or “spamming”) to a fraction of agents in the early phase of the product cycle. Under the optimal scheme, the designer spams very little about a product right after its release but gradually increases the frequency of spamming and stops it altogether when the product is deemed sufficiently unworthy of recommendation. The optimal recommender system involves randomly triggered spamming when recommendations are public -- as is often the case for product ratings -- and an information “blackout” followed by a burst of spamming when agents can choose when to check in for a recommendation. Fully transparent recommendations may become optimal if a (socially-benevolent) designer does not observe the agents’ costs of experimentation.",31

Field of Medicine: Residency training in America 
 
Format: Hardcover book. Trim size: 6½ × 9½ inches 
 
Recommended Readership: Anyone interested in or involved with medical education and patient care in America 
 
Purpose: To provide the first-ever account of the residency system for training doctors in the United States 
 
Content: There are 334 pages of text and 13 chapters that trace residency training in America from its 19th-century roots through its present-day struggles with bureaucratic work-hour regulations for house officers. The book focuses on the experience of being a resident, on how that experience has changed over the years, and on the extent to which the current training system meets its obligation to produce competent doctors. 
 
Especially well done is Kenneth Ludmerer's discussion of the intensely emotional and divisive controversy regarding resident work-hour limits. He argues convincingly that the evidence linking patient safety to residents' workload and to the quality of supervision they receive is much stronger than the evidence linking patient safety to residents' fatigue from long work hours. In addition, he emphasizes that the current imposition of rigid work rules does not allow house officers enough time to complete their responsibilities. This deprives residents of the opportunity to establish meaningful bonds with their patients, to learn the natural history of disease, and to acquire the knowledge and skills necessary to perform their specialties well. 
 
By contrast, Ludmerer cites 2 relatively recent experimental models of residency training in internal medicine that successfully coped with many of the current harmful trends in medical education. One of the programs took place at Faulkner Hospital in Boston, the other at Johns Hopkins Bayview Center in Baltimore. In both models, the number of patients assigned to each resident was cut in half. The reduced census enabled residents to spend more time with their patients, make home visits, participate in teaching sessions, and work with mentors to improve their history-taking, counseling, and ability to create individualized treatment plans. They also had more time to read, reflect, and find new meaning in their work. 
 
Ludmerer points out that our country's commercialized system of patient care endangers the education of tomorrow's doctors and gives lip service to patient-centered care. Moreover, residents are acquiring habits and approaches to patient care in which tests and procedures are often obtained simply because they are available, not because they are needed. Residents are also learning in an environment that encourages doctors to see as many patients as possible in the shortest amount of time, which prevents a substantial number of patients from receiving the care, thought, and attention that they deserve and need. 
 
The book has a table of contents, a preface, and acknowledgments. Following the text are 74 pages of extensive notes on the preface and 13 chapters, and it all culminates in a 20-page index. 
 
Strengths: If ever there was a treasure-trove of information on residency training in America, this book is it. Every page offers something worthwhile and memorable. The writing is clear and captivating. Particularly impressive are the quality of the research and the meticulous manner in which Ludmerer presents his results. For these reasons—together with the unquestionable importance of the subject covered—I consider this book to be a prime candidate for the Pulitzer Prize.

","Recommender systems are used to make recommendations about products, information, or services for users. Most existing recommender systems implicitly assume one particular type of user behavior. However, they seldom consider user-recommender interactive scenarios in real-world environments. In this paper, we propose a hybrid recommender system based on user-recommender interaction and evaluate its performance with recall and diversity metrics. First, we define the user-recommender interaction. The recommender system accepts user request, recommends N items to the user, and records user choice. If some of these items favor the user, she will select one to browse and continue to use recommender system, until none of the recommended items favors her. Second, we propose a hybrid recommender system combining random and k-nearest neighbor algorithms. Third, we redefine the recall and diversity metrics based on the new scenario to evaluate the recommender system. Experiments results on the well-known MovieLens dataset show that the hybrid algorithm is more effective than nonhybrid ones.",10

At the third level, the similarity analysis between the relationships is identified using collaborative analysis. To perform the collaborative analysis, correlation coefficient will be used. Once these three level analysis will be completed, the next work is to conclude the relationship using weighted approach. The weightage will be applied all three methods and obtain the analysis.

","A study on the pharmaceutical importance of some medicinal pants used for the treatment of livestock ailments was conducted during summer 2010 in different parts of Saudi Arabia, where no such study has been conducted so far. The aim of the study was to identify and document the medicinal plants used for the treatment of different livestock ailment in the traditional system of Arab medicine. Ethno-veterinary information was collected through the show-and-tell/semi-structured method and personal interviews during field trips. The methodology is largely based on the Sustainable Livelihood Framework, which is based on the premise that livelihood is not about resource productivity but it is about people and their lives. The study revealed 24 plants species of ethno-veterinary importance. These were used for the curing of various livestock ailments such as gastrointestinal disorders, fever, cough, respiratory tract infection, urinary tract diseases, promote lactation, wound healing, placenta removal, deworming, carminative, paralysis and flatulence in Arab system of medicine. Some plants were used singly while many others were used in combination with other plants or edible items. Similarly, few plants species are considered for the treatment of only one specific disease while several other have multiple such uses. The detail local uses, local recipe preparation, application and disease treated were reported for each species. The study concluded that, the medicinal plant knowledge of the people is strongly influenced by Arab system of traditional medicine and that medicinal plants have exerted and continue to exert, a strong influence on the standardization of plant knowledge among rural populations in Saudi Arabi. However, distinct local use of plants also exists; indicating that plant knowledge specific to the local Badous is alive and practiced. The study recommends scientific validity and toxicity tests of the medicinal plants used in traditional Arab system of medicine.

","For more than a decade, recommender systems have been proposed as a key tool to overcome information overload, and many algorithms and systems have been developed. Despite all these efforts, recommender systems still face many challenges—such as improving prediction accuracy, data sparsity, and cold-start issues. On the other hand, the recent emergence of online social networks provides us with an unprecedented large amount of information regarding user behavior and friend interactions. Especially, homophily effects among friends have demonstrated their importance to product marketing, and marketing strategies that utilize homophily have achieved great success. However, such information has not yet been considered in recommender systems. 
In this dissertation we propose a new paradigm of recommender systems which can significantly improve performance by utilizing information in social networks. In particular, we address the following challenging issues in building a social network-based recommender system. 1) We investigate the existence of homophily among friends in rating items using statistical analyses on a dataset crawled from a real online social network, Yelp.com. 2) To understand the role of social relationships in a social network-based recommender system, we develop a Bayesian network-based recommender system (SNRS-BN) based on a simplified homogeneous social network, and study the performance of SNRS-BN under different types of social relationships. 3) We develop a social network-based recommender system (SNRS) which utilizes more information in social network, including user preferences, an item's likability, and homophily effects among friends, to provide better recommendations. An iterative classification has been adopted in this system to incorporate homophily even from friends at multiple hops away. The performance improvements of SNRS are validated through experiments on the Yelp dataset in terms of both prediction accuracy and coverage over traditional recommender systems. 4) To overcome the problems of heterogeneities in social networks, we propose to select relevant friends for inference based on the semantics in fine-grained user ratings on their buying decisions. An experiment is carried out in a graduate student class to validate performance improvements from such semantic filtering. 5) We discuss the trust issues caused by malicious users and users with unreliable domain knowledge in SNRS. In particular, for the case of users with unreliable domain knowledge, we propose to estimate homophily more robustly by relaxing the item category information according to item taxonomy. Future work in this direction will be desirable.",31

","With proliferation of learning contents on the web, finding suitable ones has become a very difficult and complicated task for online learners, to achieve better performance. Nevertheless, recommender systems can be a solution to the problem. However, recommendation systems haven't been sufficiently used in e-learning, in comparison with other fields (i.e. commerce, medicine and so on). In this paper, we propose a semantic recommender system for e-learning by means of which, learners will be able to find and choose the right learning materials suitable to their field of interest. The proposed web based recommendation system comprises ontology and web ontology language (OWL) rules. Rule filtering will be used as recommendation technique. Our proposed recommendation system architecture consists of two subsystems; Semantic Based System and Rule Based System. Modules for either subsystem are; Observer, Learner profile, Recommendation storage and User interface.",11

","As the size of the domestic credit card market is steadily growing, the marketing method for credit card companies to secure customers is also changing. The process of understanding individual preferences and payment patterns has become an essential element, and it has developed a sophisticated personalized marketing method to properly understand customers’ interests and meet their needs. Based on this, a personalized system that recommends products or stores suitable for customers acts to attract customers more effectively. However, the existing research model implementing the General Framework using the neural network cannot reflect the major domain information of credit card payment data when applied directly to store recommendations. This study intends to propose a model specializing in the recommendation of member stores by reflecting the domain information of credit card payment data. The customers’ gender and age information were added to the learning data. The industry category and region information of the settlement member stores were reconstructed to be learned together with interaction data. A personalized recommendation system was realized by combining historical card payment data with customer and member store information to recommend member stores that are highly likely to be used by customers in the future. This study’s proposed model (NMF_CSI) showed a performance improvement of 3% based on HR@10 and 5% based on NDCG@10, compared to previous models. In addition, customer coverage was expanded so that the recommended model can be applied not only to customers actively using credit cards but also to customers with low usage data.",7

","ApplicationApplication-specific reasoning mechanisms (ASRMs) development is a rapidly growing domain of systems engineering. A demonstrative implementation of an active recommender system (ARS) was realized to support designing ASRMs and to circumvent procedural obstacles by providing context-sensitive recommendations. The specific problem for the research presented in this paper was the development of a synthetic validation agent (SVA) to simulate the decisional behaviour of designers and to generate data about the usefulness of the recommendations. The fact of the matter is that the need for the SVA was raised by the pandemic, which prevented involving groups of human designers in the recommendation testing process. The reported research had three practical goals: (i) development of the logical fundamentals for the SVA, (ii) computational implementation of the SVA, and (iii) application of the SVA in data generation for the evaluation of usefulness of recommendation. The SVA is based on a probabilistic decisional model that quantifies decisional options according to the assumed decisional tendencies. The three key concepts underlying the SVA are (i) decisional logic, (ii) decisional knowledge, and (iii) decisional probability. These together enable generation of reliable data about the decisional behaviours of human designers concerning the obtained recommendations. The completed tests proved the above assumption.",7

","Recommender systems (RS) are systems that use historical information about user-item interaction in each online environment and suggest new items to users. Because of their high commercial importance, both their initial applications and research has focused on making them more accurate. However, it was later observed that users’ preference changes over time and systems fail to catch up to those changes. Hence, the importance of personalization of RS had been concluded [1]. System engineers introduced control mechanisms which aimed to “involve the users in personalization process and have an immediate effect on recommendations” [2]. Previous research concluded ambiguous effects of those mechanisms. This raises the question about the acceptance of such systems which is the main objective of this study. Traditionally, the acceptance of a particular technology is determined by one’s behavioral intentions to use it [3]. Technology acceptance model (TAM) has been a seminal work in IT acceptance and adoption [4]. The core theory suggests that BI is affected by perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness. TAM has been extended and used extensively in numerous settings in IS literature. We also use TAM and broaden it with user control as an additional moderating variable. We hypothesize that control mechanisms have three main effects in this framework: a) it increases perceived usefulness b) it decreases perceived ease of use c) it has direct effect on behavioral intentions. We develop an experimental design where a participant is presented with a choice task to select five options from a given choice set following a pre-defined user preference. Pre-defined preference allows us to evaluate their performance and tie their remuneration to it. Study subjects are also presented recommended options which in their initial state are detached from the pre-defined user preference. Participants can use control mechanisms to personalize the recommendations. By means of availably tools, they can determine the level with which recommender system reflects their (pre-defined) tastes. Such setting allows us to study which part of performance differential is due to quality of recommendations. The ability to sort the options across any of the features is added to the interface. Notice, that even though using this feature could potentially help subjects to solve the task it does not provide a useful input to the recommender system and, therefore, does not change recommended options. Hence, it can be seen as a manifestation of the illusion of control. Our study allows to explicitly evaluate trade-off between user control and RS acceptance. We also address the generalizability issue of the previous studies investigating user control. Additionally, this study can enable system designers to optimize user participation in personalization.",19

","Recommender system is widely implemented in various fields. Collaborative Filtering is one of the most used recommender system paradigms because it is easy to use. K-means clustering algorithm is widely use in Collaborative Filtering. This algorithm can predict the item rating that will be given by a user. Rating can be predicted by calculating the average rating of the item. The clustering performance of this algorithm is low because this algorithm selects initial centroid randomly. This causes high errors in the item rating prediction. To obtain lower error, we propose dimensionality reduction with Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). SVD is able to factorize the clustering result data and reduce dimensionality of the data. Dimensionality reduction with SVD can be carried out by removing non-dominant characteristics of the data. This study uses the result of factorization to calculate the similarity between clusters. The value of similarity between clusters is used to predict the rating of an item that will be given by a cluster. The experimental results show that the combined method of K-means and SVD can produces RMSE up to 8.936% lower than the K-means method.",7

","Modern recommender systems are often modelled under the sequential decision-making paradigm, where the system decides which recommendations to show in order to maximise some notion of either imminent or long-term reward. Such methods often require an explicit model of the reward a certain context-action pair will yield – for example, the probability of a click on a recommendation. This common machine learning task is highly non-trivial, as the data-generating process for contexts and actions can be skewed by the recommender system itself. Indeed, when the deployed recommendation policy at data collection time does not pick its actions uniformly-at-random, this leads to a selection bias that can impede effective reward modelling. This in turn makes off-policy learning – the typical setup in industry – particularly challenging. Existing approaches for value-based learning break down in such environments. In this work, we propose and validate a general pessimistic reward modelling approach for off-policy learning in recommendation. Bayesian uncertainty estimates allow us to express scepticism about our own reward model, which can in turn be used to generate a conservative decision rule. We show how it alleviates a well-known decision making phenomenon known as the Optimiser’s Curse, and draw parallels with existing work on pessimistic policy learning. Leveraging the available closed-form expressions for both the posterior mean and variance when a ridge regressor models the reward, we show how to apply pessimism effectively and efficiently to an off-policy recommendation use-case. Empirical observations in a wide range of simulated environments show that pessimistic decision-making leads to a significant and robust increase in recommendation performance. The merits of our approach are most outspoken in realistic settings with limited logging randomisation, limited training samples, and larger action spaces. We discuss the impact of our contributions in the context of related applications like computational advertising, and present a scope for future research based on hybrid off-/on-policy bandit learning methods for recommendation.",19

","Medicine recommendation systems target to recommend a set of medicines given a set of symptoms which play a crucial role in assisting doctors in their daily clinics. Existing approaches are either rule-based or supervised. However, the former heavily relies on expert labeling, which is time-consuming and costly to collect, and the latter suffers from the data sparse problem. To automate medicine recommendation on sparse data, we propose MedRec, which introduces two graphs in modeling: (1) a knowledge graph connecting diseases, medicines, symptoms, and examinations; (2) an attribute graph connecting medicines via shared attributes and molecular structures. These two graphs enhance the connectivity between symptoms and medicines, which thus alleviate the data sparse problem. By learning the interrelationship between diseases, medicines, symptoms and examinations and the inner relationship within medicine, we can acquire unified embedding representations of symptoms and medicines which can be used in medicine recommendation. The experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods. In addition, we find that these two tasks: learning graph representation and medical recommendation can benefit each other.",11

","Intermediaries such as Amazon and Google recommend products and services to consumers for which they receive compensation from the recommended sellers. Consumers will find these recommendations useful only if they are informative about the quality of the match between the sellers’ offerings and the consumer’s needs. The intermediary would like the consumer to purchase the product from the recommended seller, but is constrained because consumers need not follow the recommendation. I frame the intermediary’s problem as a mechanism design problem in which the mechanism designer cannot directly choose the outcome, but must encourage the consumer to choose the desired outcome. I show that in the optimal mechanism, the recommended seller has the largest non-negative virtual willingness to pay adjusted for the cost of persuasion. The optimal mechanism can be implemented via a handicap auction. I use this model to provide insights for current policy debates. First, to examine the impact of the intermediary’s use of seller data, I identify types of seller data that lead to benefit or harm to the consumer and sellers. Second, I find that the optimal direct mechanism protects consumer privacy, but consumer data is leaked to sellers under other implementations. Lastly, I show that the welfare-maximizing mechanism increases the consumer surplus, but reduces the joint profit of the intermediary and sellers relative to the revenue-maximizing mechanism. ∗University of Pennsylvania.

","Recommender systems are endemic, increasingly used for social decision-making processes, reducing a complex human to a single data item, and are unfortunately known for bias particularly when used in the context of criminal justice. Administrative demands, ‘doing more with less’, ensure that recommender systems will remain in use to varying degrees in different jurisdictions. Consider the potential circumstances of a judicial officer using a false positive bail recommendation to release a serial rapist into the community, or a false negative bail recommendation to remand a defendant where they have carer's responsibility for elderly parents or children. Quality assurance including quality control activities are standard in other fields, namely medicine, however software quality assurance for recommender systems supporting social decision-making processes has not yet matured, focusing on technical internal system improvements. When the outcome of a data-driven recommender system can erroneously drastically impose on freedom, we need to have reliable quality assurance alongside the ability to invoke our “right to be an exception” [1]. This paper briefly outlines the co-design and testing of a novel quality control validation tool (VAL *©) that highlights such exceptions, independent of recommender systems, with case studies.

","Netflix is one of the most widely used applications for watching movies online.

Twitter is a social media used to express ideas, thoughts, and feelings. Not a few Twitter users who conduct movie discussions, with the movie discussion can be converted into a rating that can be used in the recommendation system. Collaborative Filtering is one of the methods of the recommendation system, by recommending based on the similarity between users (user-based) and based on items that have similarities with user-selected items (item-based). In this research, the Collaborative Filtering method is combined with K-Nearest Neighbors classification which obtains an RMSE value for user-based 1.8244 and item-based 0.5449. K-Nearest Neighbors gets 91.22% precision and 91.07% recall for user-based, while item-based gets 89.44% precision and 91.22% recall with the optimal K as a parameter is 3.",13

","In modern times, the movie industry is growing rapidly. Netflix is one of the platforms that can be used to watch movies and provides many types of genres and movie titles. With so many genres and movie titles sometimes making it difficult for people to choose a movie to watch, one solution to the problem is a recommendation system that can recommend movies based on user ratings. One method in the recommendation system is collaborative filtering. One of the algorithms contained in collaborative filtering is singular value decomposition. Twitter is one of the places where people often write their opinions about the movies they have watched, from people's tweets on Twitter will be processed into rating value data. In this system, tweets become input that is processed into data that has a rating. This research implements a user-based recommendation system based on ratings from tweets using collaborative filtering combined with the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) algorithm and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification and implemented it on user-based and item-based. This research aims to implement a system that combines collaborative filtering techniques with the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) algorithm and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification. With the hope of producing a good movie recommendation model and providing accurate predictions for recommended and non-recommended movies. The test results in this study show that Collaborative Filtering gets the best RMSE value of 0.8162 on user-based and 0.5911 on item-based. The combination of Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) algorithm and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification using hyperparameter tuning resulted in 81% precision and 81% recall for user-based while 80% precision and 80% recall for item-based.",47

","Green marketing has become an important and innovative method for companies to remain profitable and competitive as the public and governments are more concerned about environmental issues. However, most online shopping environments do not consider product greenness in their recommender systems or other shopping tools. This paper aims to propose the use of recommender systems to aid the green shopping process and to promote green consumerism basing upon the benefits of recommender systems and a compliance technique called foot-in-the-door (FITD). With the implementation of this concept, the Authors et al. are of the opinion that the marketing of Electronic Goods in India shall see an upsurge. In this study, the architecture of a recommender system for green consumer electronics is proposed. Customers’ decision-making process is modelled with an adaptive fuzzy inference system in which the input variables are the degrees of price, feature, and greenness and output variables are the estimated rating data. The architecture has three types of recommendation: information filtering, candidate expansion, and crowd recommendation. Ad hoc customization can be applied to tune the recommendation results. The findings are reported in two parts. The first part describes the potentials of using recommender systems in green marketing and the promotion of green consumerism; the second part describes the proposed recommender system architecture using green consumer electronics as the context. Discussion of the proposed architecture and comparison with other systems are also included in this part. The proposed architecture provides a capable platform for personalized green marketing by offering customers shopping advices tailored to their preferences and for the promotion of green consumerism.

","Recent advances in Internet of Things (IoT) and the rising of the Internet of Behavior (IoB) have made it possible to develop real-time improved traveler assistance tools for mobile phones, assisted by cloud-based machine learning, and using fog computing in between IoT and the Cloud. Within the Horizon2020-funded mF2C project an Android app has been developed exploiting the proximity marketing concept and covers the essential path through the airport onto the flight, from the least busy security queue through to the time to walk to gate, gate changes, and other obstacles that airports tend to entertain travelers with. It gives chance to travelers to discover the facilities of the airport, aided by a recommender system using machine learning, that can make recommendations and offer voucher according with the traveler’s preferences or on similarities to other travelers. The system provides obvious benefits to the airport planners,  not only people tracking in the shops area, but also aggregated and anonymized view, like heat maps that can highlight bottlenecks in the infrastructure, or suggest situations that require intervention, such as emergencies. With the emerging of the COVID pandemic the tool could be adapted to help in the social distancing to guarantee safety. The use of the fog-to-cloud platform and the fulfilling of all centricity and privacy requirements of the IoB give evidence of the impact of the solution. Doi: 10.28991/HIJ-2021-02-04-01 Full Text: PDF",36

","Information technology and the popularity of mobile devices allow for various types of customer data, such as purchase history and behavior patterns, to be collected. As customer data accumulate, the demand for recommender systems that provide customized services to customers is growing. Global e-commerce companies offer recommender systems to gain a sustainable competitive advantage. Research on recommender systems has consistently suggested that customer satisfaction will be highest when the recommendation algorithm is accurate and recommends a diversity of items. However, few studies have investigated the impact of accuracy and diversity on customer satisfaction. In this research, we seek to identify the factors determining customer satisfaction when using the recommender system. To this end, we develop several recommender systems and measure their ability to deliver accurate and diverse recommendations and their ability to generate customer satisfaction with diverse data sets. The results show that accuracy and diversity positively affect customer satisfaction when applying a deep learning-based recommender system. By contrast, only accuracy positively affects customer satisfaction when applying traditional recommender systems. These results imply that developers or managers of recommender systems need to identify factors that further improve customer satisfaction with the recommender system and promote the sustainable development of e-commerce.",11

","In a previous paper in this journal (IJNS), it is mentioned about a possible approach of “curemony” as a middle way in order to reconcile Eastern and Western’s paradigms of medicine [1]. Although it is known in literature that there are some attempts to reconcile between Eastern and Western medicine paradigms, known as “integrative medicine,” here a new viewpoint is submitted, i.e. Bong Han duct system (PVS), which is a proof of Meridian system, can be a bridge between those two medicine paradigms in neutrosophic sense. This can be considered as a Neutrosophic Logic way to bridge or reconcile the age-old debates over the Western and Eastern approach to medicine. It is also hoped that there will be further research in this direction, especially to clarify the distinction between Pasteur’s germ theory and Bechamp’s microzyma theory. More research is obviously recommended. Motivation of this paper: to prove that Neutrosophic Logic offers a reconciliation towards better dialogue between Western and Eastern medicine systems. Novelty aspect: it is discussed here how Bong Han Duct system offers a proven and observable way to Meridian system, which in turn it can be a good start to begin meaningful dialogue between Western and Eastern systems.",35

","Recommender systems are everywhere, from e-commerce to streaming platforms. They help users lost in the maze of available information, items and services to find their way. Among them, over the years, approaches based on machine learning techniques have shown particularly good performance for top-N recommendations engines. Unfortunately, they mostly behave as black-boxes and, even when they embed some form of description about the items to recommend, after the training phase they move such descriptions in a latent space thus loosing the actual explicit semantics of recommended items. As a consequence, the system designers struggle at providing satisfying explanations to the recommendation list provided to the end user. In this chapter, we describe two approaches to recommendation which make use of the semantics encoded in a knowledge graph to train interpretable models which keep the original semantics of the items description thus providing a powerful tool to automatically compute explainable results. The two methods relies on two completely different machine learning algorithms, namely, factorization machines and autoencoder neural networks. We also show how to measure the interpretability of the model through the introduction of two metrics: semantic accuracy and robustness.",19

The aim of the paper is to extend the areas of the recommender system/recommendation systems. The basic task of the recommender system mainly is to predict or analyze items/product. If it is possible to include more products in the system, then obviously the system may be extended for other areas also. For example, Medicine is a product and doctors filter the particular medicine for the particular disease. In the medical diagnosis doctors prescribed a medicine and it a product. It depends on the disease of the user/patient so here doctor predicts a medicine or product just like an item is recommended in a recommender system. The main objective of the paper is to extend the Recommender System/Recommendation system in other fields so that the research works can be extended Social Science, Bio-medical Science and many other areas.",11

","Recommender models are hard to evaluate, particularly under offline setting. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive and critical analysis of the data leakage issue in recommender system offline evaluation. Data leakage is caused by not observing global timeline in evaluating recommenders e.g., train/test data split does not follow global timeline. As a result, a model learns from the user-item interactions that are not expected to be available at prediction time. We first show the temporal dynamics of user-item interactions along global timeline, then explain why data leakage exists for collaborative filtering models. Through carefully designed experiments, we show that all models indeed recommend future items that are not available at the time point of a test instance, as the result of data leakage. The experiments are conducted with four widely used baseline models - BPR, NeuMF, SASRec, and LightGCN, on four popular offline datasets - MovieLens-25M, Yelp, Amazon-music, and Amazon-electronic, adopting leave-last-one-out data split. We further show that data leakage does impact models’ recommendation accuracy. Their relative performance orders thus become unpredictable with different amount of leaked future data in training. To evaluate recommendation systems in a realistic manner in offline setting, we propose a timeline scheme, which calls for a revisit of the recommendation model design.",7

","A recommender aids the user explore the set of items in a system and find the most relevant items to him/her. The two basic recommender categories are the contextand score-based ones. The first category exploits the characteristics of users and items, while the latter depends on the item scores given by the users. Traditional implementations of recommenders are based on TF-IDF and nearest neighbors techniques, while more recent recommenders follow machine learning approaches, like matrix factorization and neural networks. A natural issue that comes along with recommendations is whether a user, or even the system designer understands the results of the recommender. This problem has given rise to the so-called explainable recommenders.",19

","A recommender system supports customers to find information, products, or services (such as music, books, movies, web sites, and digital contents), so it could help customers to make rapid routine decisions and save their time and money. However, most existing recommender systems do not recommend items that are already purchased by the target customer, so are not suitable for considering customers’ repetitive purchase behavior or purchasing order. In this research, we suggest a multi-period product recommender system, which can learn customers’ purchasing order and customers’ repetitive purchase pattern. For such a purpose we applied the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), which is one of the artificial neural network structures specialized in time series data analysis, instead of collaborative filtering techniques. Recommendation periods are segmented as various time-steps, and the proposed RNN-based recommender system can recommend items by multiple periods in a time sequence. Several experiments with real online food market data show that the proposed system shows higher performance in accuracy and diversity in a multi-period perspective than the collaborative filtering-based system. From the experimental results, we conclude that the proposed system is suitable for multi-period product recommendation, which results in robust performance considering well customers’ purchasing orders and customers’ repetitive purchase patterns. Moreover, in terms of sustainability, we expect that our study contributes to the reduction of food wastes by inducing planned consumption, and the reduction of shopping time and effort.",43

This paper proposes a systematic approach for targeting customers and providing maximum profit to the organizations. An important initial step is to analyze the data of sales acquired from the purchase history and determine the parameters that have the maximum correlation. We focus on the parameters recency and frequency of the purchases made by the customers to perform clustering. Based on respective clusters, proper resources can be channeled towards profitable customers using machine learning algorithms.

","Due to the development of the internet, there is today explosive growth and diversity of information. Thus, decision making in various fields has faced different challenges. Recommender systems by identifying of the interests of users, data filtering and data management, offer personalized services to users. This is beneficial for marketing and user satisfaction. According to researchers, the Collaborative Filtering (CF) is one of the most successful methods of recommender system. CF based on the similarity between users. We argue that similarity is a fuzzy notion and we get more realistic results in recommender systems by using fuzzy logic. fuzzy logic is kind of new technologies that is based on the multi-value logic. This technology can replace complicated calculations and advanced mathematics in designing and modeling of a system. fuzzy logic is an effective method to identify ambiguities and uncertainty in measuring the similarity of items and users. In this research, we present a new fuzzy similarity measure for recommender systems which is based on popularity and significance. In this work, in order to improve the accuracy and quality of recommendations, we have used a fuzzy logic. To evaluate the contribution of this work, we use MAE, F1, recall, and precision. The MAE value based on the proposed fuzzy similarity measure is equal to 0.46 and outperforms the NHSM respectively by %5. Also, using the proposed fuzzy similarity measure, we obtain a F1 value equal to 0.65, which outperforms the PIP and NHSM respectively by %17 and %20. We have also observed an improvement in recall and precision using the proposed approach .

","Most of the higher education institutions in the world have already been evaluating their strategies of enhancing the employability of their students and introducing different ways to improve and strengthen it. Identifying student’s employability and recommend the areas for improvement before graduation will increase the chance to be employed if the students developed their employability skills. That is why in this paper the rule-based algorithm that is commonly used in developing a recommender system were replaced by Fuzzy logic based because rule-based cannot eliminate the ambiguity issues in decision-making, whether they are hirable or not before graduation. Various factors may affect the employability of undergraduate students. In this paper, the employability prediction and recommender system for students were built using fuzzy logic to resolve the issue. The most significant attributes that affect the undergraduate students’ employability were determined using feature selection filtering techniques and used as inputs. The result shows that the developed fuzzy model performs a high predictive accuracy based on the computed mean absolute error (MAE) and root-mean-square error (RMSE) scores which decrease from the training to the validation and test sets.",0

","Annotation. This article discusses a two-mass system with a rigid fixation of the end part (foundation) of the bridge on high-speed railways. The results of selecting the optimal parameters of dynamic vibration dampers (DVDs) for setting stiffness and damping in the case of a two-mass system with a rigidly fixed end part of the bridge are presented. It is shown that such a solution is recommended for the case when the bridge is located in a steep gorge, the intermediate supports are high and flexible, and the end supports are quite rigid, since they give the designer a wide opportunity to choose the dimensions and rigidity of the designed seismic protection elements.",5

","Many companies operate e-commerce websites to sell fashion products. Some customers want to buy products with intention of sustainability and therefore the companies need to suggest appropriate fashion products to those customers. Recommender systems are key applications in these sustainable digital marketing strategies and high performance is the most necessary factor. This research aims to improve recommendation systems’ performance by considering item session and attribute session information. We suggest the Item Session-Based Recommender (ISBR) and the Attribute Session-Based Recommenders (ASBRs) that use item and attribute session data independently, and then we suggest the Feature-Weighted Session-Based Recommenders (FWSBRs) that combine multiple ASBRs with various feature weighting schemes. Our experimental results show that FWSBR with chi-square feature weighting scheme outperforms ISBR, ASBRs, and Collaborative Filtering Recommender (CFR). In addition, it is notable that FWSBRs overcome the cold-start item problem, one significant limitation of CFR and ISBR, without losing performance.",21

","It is evident that the need for personalized product recommendation is much needed these days. Generally, product recommender systems are implemented in web servers that make use of data, implicitly obtained as results of the collection of Web browsing patterns of the users. Here, the project's motive is to provide location-based agricultural product recommendation system using a novel KNN algorithm by ensuring effective communication and transparency in agriculture trade marketing among buyers and sellers (farmers). It helps the farmer to fix up the market price by preventing the rue pricing of their products. The farmer can post their products into the application with price and other details like a timestamp of harvesting, color, size, the absence of pest, freshness, ripeness etc. Based on the location, the distance between the seller and buyer is calculated using great circle distance. An improved Novel KNN algorithm is used to find the K Nearest Seller by calculating the distance between the sellers and buyer using a Euclidean distance metric. The details posted by the farmers and buyers are stored and updated in a database dynamically. The recommender system recommends nearest sellers and their agricultural products based on buyer interest. The performance of the system is analyzed in terms of accuracy and mean absolute error.",11

The key thought is to manufacture a central server that will accumulate the clients'applications information and play out the static and dynamic investigation of an Android application to locate the risky examples and will group it as malicious or benign. This assignment will require huge processing power. Here, the importance of big data comes into picture. Already existed and suggested frameworks have been tremendously helpful, and huge information is the main impetus behind proposal frameworks. Our planned mechanism additionally plans to gather a lot of client information; for example, it adds up to a number of downloads, clients'audits, consents required by an application, and designers data to give relevant and powerful proposals. There is a need of a dynamic malware investigation system which uses the innovations of graphical user interface (GUI)-based testing, big data examination, and machine figuring out how to identify malignant Android applications.

","A recommender system is an information filtering system that has become a buzzword in various areas of marketing and research such as movies, music, books, products and research articles. The main role of recommender systems is to guide users on a personal level to provide an optimum set of suggestions based on the users’ taste, explicit rating of items, his/her demographic and other related valuable information. In the past decade, several approaches have been discussed for recommendation of items to online users keeping in mind the accuracy of prediction, the cold-start problem and the problem of sparsity. However, most of these existing recommender system techniques have failed to define a proper recommendation model that can be well suited for any online social network and can consider majority of the limitations when modeling real-market recommendations. In this paper, we present a novel efficient recommender system technique RecGyp and many other standard commonly used existing prediction techniques and also perform experimental evaluations to make a comparative analysis among each technique. The experiments carried out on the MovieLens 100K and the Yahoo! Webscope Movie datasets demonstrate the superior nature of the proposed RecGyp technique in solving the scalability issue and accuracy of results for recommending items to users of a social network. In addition to the traditional similarity measurements evaluation, results are also provided for three evaluation metrics, Precision, Recall and ROC, to evaluate the accuracy of all the recommender system techniques",39

","Current Therapy in Medicine of Australian Mammals provides an update on Australian mammal medicine. Although much of the companion volume, Medicine of Australian Mammals, is still relevant and current, there have been significant advances in Australian mammal medicine and surgery since its publication in 2008. The two texts together remain the most comprehensive source of information available in this field. 
This volume is divided into two sections. The first includes comprehensive chapters on general topics and topics relevant to multiple taxa. Several new topics are presented including: wildlife health in Australia and the important role veterinarians play in Australia’s biosecurity systems; medical aspects of native mammal reintroductions and translocations; disease risk analysis; wildlife rehabilitation practices in Australia with an emphasis on welfare of animals undergoing rehabilitation; management of overabundant populations; immunology; and stress physiology. The second section provides updates on current knowledge relevant to specific taxa. Several appendices provide useful reference data and information on clinical reference ranges, recommended venipuncture sites, chemical restraint agent doses and regimens, a drug formulary and dental charts. 
Written by Australian experts, Current Therapy in Medicine of Australian Mammals is clinically oriented, with emphasis on practical content with easy-to-use reference material. It is a must-have for veterinarians, students, biologists, zoologists and wildlife carers and other wildlife professionals. This volume also complements, updates and utilises the resources of other books such as Radiology of Australian Mammals (Vogelnest and Allan 2015), Pathology of Australian Native Wildlife (Ladds 2009), Haematology of Australian Mammals (Clark 2004) and Australian Mammals: Biology and Captive Management (Jackson 2003), all CSIRO Publishing publications.

HPs offer activities that are catalysts to the community development, focusing those in the rural areas. However, due to technological advancements, promotion and marketing strategy for the unique CBT initiative needs a new and inventive move.  This leads to the proposed technology-based framework for a system as part of the specific CBT supply chain (CBTSC), known as the Collaborative-based Web Recommender (CBWR) system or simply, website. The CBTSC is further intensified to emerge the CBWR sub-supply chain model. As part of the CBWR model, the CBWR website is able to essentially promote the CBT effort of HP worldwide, thus supports community development and livelihood.

","In face-to-face interactions, advice acceptance depends on how it is presented, as well as a number of social factors. For example, some persons are inclined to accept advice from an expert if they possess little domain knowledge. In contrast, if such advice is unsolicited, persons might only accept advice from a trusted source, such as a family member. Whether these mechanisms also play a role in the recommender context is unknown, even though advice solicitation may be particularly important in domains where a recommender user seeks behavioral change (e.g. energy conservation, healthy eating). This study examines the role of advice solicitation (i.e. whether one asks for advice or simply receives it) and advice source (i.e. either explained in social terms or not) in our ‘Saving Aid’ energy recommender system. Through a web-based user study with 252 participants, we find that allowing users to solicit advice themselves increases their perceived level of trust with our energy recommender system, compared to users that are presented unsolicited advice. In turn, we find that trust positively affects user satisfaction levels, as well as the number of chosen energy-saving measures. We discuss how system designers should consider how advice is presented and in which context.",37

","Association rule mining (ARM) alone is a classical yet powerful method for basic rule discovery. However, generic measures being used are insufficient for specific pattern generation and rules of business interest. Critical decision making is a “key” component in contemporary businesses which could be rewarded by periodically utilizing patterns and rules to steer business growth and profit as well. To effectuate self-propelled growth in businesses, a feasible optimal recommender system needs to be accomplished without human intervention that recommends targeted product marketing and promotional strategies. In conjunction to ARM, uncertainty is a growing challenge in data mining research with facets of being probabilistic, fuzzy, or vague. Among many set theories to surmount uncertainty, vague set theory is employed for handling vagueness in data which gives the motivation of implementing a knowledge-based recommender framework by aggregating the two approaches to predict uncertain market growth strategy patterns and profitable rules.",16

A collaborative filtering approach is going to filter and recognize the similar services under same cluster and followed by those evaluations recommendations are made Recommender systems are now popular both commercially and in the research community, where many approaches have been suggested for providing recommendations. In many cases a system designer that wishes to employ a recommendation system must choose between a set of candidate approaches. A first step towards selecting an appropriate algorithm is to decide which properties of the application to focus upon when making this choice. Indeed, recommendation systems have a variety of properties that may affect user experience, such as accuracy, robustness, scalability, and so forth. In this paper the system discusses how to compare recommenders based on a set of properties that are relevant for the application. Recommender systems can now be found in many modern applications that expose the user to huge collections of items. Such systems typically provide the user with a list of recommended items they might prefer, or predict how much they might prefer each item. These systems help users to decide on appropriate items, and ease the task of finding preferred items in the collection.",29

","One of the problems that is faced in the area of bank marketing is how to adequetly offer the available products to clients, that is, the development of a specific strategy focused on the needs of each client without using the unpleasant viral marketing.To address this problem, it is useful to generate a model that formulates policies that help the bank to make decisions to offer products effectively in order to optimize the benefits of such institution. In this thesis, the problem described above will be addressed by using a recommender system that will offer specific products to each client. Due to the nature of the problem, it is necessary to consider alternative methods to the traditional recommender systems in order to diversify the solutions and to exploit the strategic advantages that each one posseses when recommending policies are generated. On the one hand, one important issue to be considered is the changing nature in the economic conditions of each person and the corresponding changes that these trigger in their behaviour. On the other hand, there is a larger amount of clients than products to be offered which is not the case in traditional recommender systems. Finally, it is expected that the recommender system will help to generate a model able to create a journey map. Additionally, the system will help to define a marketing policy to strengthen the cross-selling of products in relationship to the variations in future preferences of a specific client.",21

","The probabilistic notion of differential privacy has emerged as a popular measure for systems that support interactive data release. Consequently, there exists a portfolio of mechanisms to achieve differential privacy. A complementary approach is to represent syntactic privacy notions such as anonymity and unlinkability in the form of games. Via these games, the understanding of, and relationship between, privacy notions is clarified; further, an unambiguous understanding of adversarial actions is given. Representing privacy notions as games is aimed to invoke a 'different' perspective of visualising and abstracting privacy notions. Yet, without any practical context, these notions can be incomprehensible to system designers and software developers. We provide means to combine, enhance and extend these theoretical contributions by showing that the game-based definitions have the potential to interconnect privacy implications and to reason about privacy properties.

Today, abundant recommender systems have been developed for different fields and we put an effort on collaborative filtering (CF) recommender system. There are several problems in the recommender system such as Cold Start, Synonymy, Shilling Attacks, Privacy, Limited Content Analysis and Overspecialization, Grey Sheep, Sparsity, Scalability and Latency Problem. The current research explored the privacy in CF recommender system and defined the perspective privacy attributes (user's identity, password, address, and postcode/location) which are required to be addressed. Using the base models as Homomorphic and Hash Encryption scheme, we have proposed a hybrid model Homomorphic Hash Encryption (H2E) model that addressed the privacy issues according to defined objectives in the current study. Furthermore, in order to evaluate the privacy level, H2E was implementing in medicine recommender system and compared the consequences with existing state-of-the-art privacy protection mechanisms. It was observed that H2E outperform to other models with respect to determined privacy objectives. Leading to user's privacy, H2E can be considered a promising model for CF recommender systems.",13

","Eco-design Collaborative Filtering Recommender System is an approach to assist designers in producing a green product. Collaborative Filtering (CF) approach is the most commonly used and most successful approaches for the systems of recommendation. In eco-design (Ecological Design), several studies focused on the implementation of eco strategies to reduce the products’ environmental impact. While the raw materials of the product are even more important in order to design a product to preserve the environment. Therefore, in this paper, the researcher employ the CF to develop a new eco-design method to provide a set of raw materials to assist the designers at early stage to preserve the environment. CF system is able to overcome the information overload issue by analyzing the past behavior of its users. It’s very simple and effective way to assist eco-designer to identify the best options from alternatives. CF system introduce a set of recommendations to the product designers through comparing the new product with the existing products in data base based on products’ information. Next, determine the most similar products and rank them based on its environmental impact. Then, the components of products which have low environment impact will be provided to the eco-designers as a recommendations. An assumed example of eco-design will be used to explanation the proposed method. Further research can be conducted on this proposed method by implementing it with real dataset to generalize its performance.",13

Collaborative filtering approach need a record users or customers activity in the past to generate recommendation for example rating record, purchasing record, testimony about product.  The majority collaborative filtering approaches rely on rating as fundamental computation to calculate product recommendation. However, just a little number of consumers who willing give rating for products less than a percent, according to several convince datasets such MovieLens. This problem causes of sparse product rating that will impact to product recommendation accuracy level. Sometime, in extreme condition, it is impossible to generate product recommendation.

A 2 (Comparative vs. Decision only mindset) X 2 (Hedonic vs. Utilitarian product) between-subjects experiment was conducted. The findings suggest that comparing with alternatives alters the value perception and decision even though the actual value of the product remains the same. Value perception mediates effects of mindset on preference and purchase. The result provides implications that recommender system can leverage consumers to perceive relative value and promote purchase decision.

The ontology includes not only the semantic descriptions of the symptoms, but also the machineunderstandable perceptions of the pain location and the link weights. In the proposed model, we applied a weight spreading pseudo-fuzzy method along with the general semantic reasoners with facets management module. To keep the domain manageable, we limited the scheme to diseases that cause abdominal pain. We used Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine and Up-to-date online as our base evidence references along with the opinions from our local experts.

","The objective of this research work is to develop a proficient recommender system for effective bug triaging. We primarily focus the bug reduction system in this project with an assumption that the communication channel between developer and the bug reduction is maintained. We have to prevent redundant bug in the repository.Programming organizations spend more than 45 percent of cost in managing programming bugs. An unavoidable stride of settling bugs is bug triage, which means to effectively appoint a designer to another bug. To diminish the time cost in manual work,content order procedures are connected to lead programmed bug triage. In this paper, we address the issue of information decrease for bug triage, i.e., how to lessen the scale and enhance the nature of bug information. We consolidate occurrence determination with include choice to at the same time diminish information scale on the bug measurement and the word measurement. To decide the request of applying case choice and highlight determination, we separate characteristics from recorded bug informational collections and construct a prescient model for another bug informational collection. We observationally research the execution of information lessening on absolutely 600,000 bug reports of two huge open source ventures, in particular Eclipse and Mozilla. The outcomes demonstrate that our information decrease can adequately diminish the information scale and enhance the precision of bug triage.",1

","To make recommendation on items from the user for historical user rating several intelligent systems are using. The most common method is Recommendation systems. The main areas which play major roles are social networking, digital marketing, online shopping and E-commerce. Recommender system consists of several techniques for recommendations. Here we used the well known approach named as Collaborative filtering (CF). There are two types of problems mainly available with collaborative filtering. They are complete cold start (CCS) problem and incomplete cold start (ICS) problem. The authors proposed three novel methods such as collaborative filtering, and artificial neural networks and at last support vector machine to resolve CCS as well ICS problems. Based on the specific deep neural network SADE we can be able to remove the characteristics of products. By using sequential active of users and product characteristics we have the capability to adapt the cold start product ratings with the applications of the state of the art CF model, time SVD++. The proposed system consists of Netflix rating dataset which is used to perform the baseline techniques for rating prediction of cold start items. The calculation of two proposed recommendation techniques is compared on ICS items, and it is proved that it will be adaptable method. The proposed method can be able to transfer the products since cold start transfers to non-cold start status. Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is employed here to extract the item content features. One of the user preferences such as temporal dynamics is used to obtain the contented characteristics into predictions to overcome those problems.

","High annual customer churn rates and low customer attractions caused by poor marketing recommendations inhibit enterprises from making as much profit as they should. The purpose of this research was to derive a more optimized association rule learning algorithm that can be used in a web-based recommender system for small-scale enterprises. The method used was a case study approach on a small-scale enterprise called Makewa Hardware located in Ruiru, Kenya. Having access to the enterprise supported the use of the agile methodology, more specifically, extreme programming in the development of the system that applied the algorithm. A sample of training data consisting of transactions made in the past was obtained from the enterprise in order to create the machine learning aspects of the algorithm. The results showed that the derived association rule learning algorithm was able to learn and generate its own frequent-item-set and use this to give appropriate recommendations to customers. The results revealed the system’s ability to make more accurate recommendations. This was based on the pattern of purchases made from the hardware store by various customers. The recommendations were given on a weekly basis. The implication of the results on the subjects showed that more business owners are open to having intelligent systems help make and predict their sales. The findings can be applied not only in hardware stores but also in other retail stores. Future research can ensure that a normal dataset can be transformed into a market basket without it losing important information.

","In recent times, traditional medicine has continued to receive increasing acceptance in Nigeria among many other African nations. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that about 80% of Asia, Latin America and African populations use traditional medicine to meet their primary health care needs. For a lot of people in these countries especially those living in rural areas, traditional medicines are the only available, easily accessible and affordable source of health care. This paper has tried to trace the historical background of traditional medicine in Nigeria, its contributions and progress made so far in health care delivery. It also considered various types of traditional medical services as well as methods of healing employed by traditional medical practitioners in reaching out to their numerous patients. This paper adopted qualitative research method in its approach. Qualitative research approach permits the researcher to investigate the issues that enable decision-making behaviour in a non-numerical manner. However, due to the nature of the research, oral and group interviews were added to elicit data from respondents. Research questions were also framed to elicit information from respondents using open-ended questions. The result of the integrated content analysis shows that despite various challenges facing traditional medicine, it has contributed immensely to the development of health care delivery system in Nigeria. The paper therefore, recommends among others, that in order to adequately maximize the health-care coverage of the multi-populated traditional Nigerian villages and communities with varied and variegated health challenges, sicknesses and ailments, there is obvious need for the formalization of the traditional health care services through the integration of traditional medicine into the health care delivery systems of various local and state governments in Nigeria.",14

","This paper gives an insight on how to use big data analytics for developing effective health recommendation engine by analyzing multi structured healthcare data. Evidence-based medicine is a powerful tool to help minimize treatment variation and unexpected costs. Large amount of healthcare data such as Physician notes, medical history, medical prescription, lab and scan reports generated is useless until there is a proper method to process this data interactively in real-time. In this world filled with the latest technology, healthcare professionals feel more comfortable to utilize the social network to treat their patients effectively. To achieve this we need an effective framework which is capable of handling large amount of structured, unstructured patient data and live streaming data about the patients from their social network activities. Apache Spark plays an effective role in making meaningful analysis on the large amount of healthcare data generated with the help of machine learning components and in-memory computations supported by spark. Healthcare recommendation engine can be developed to predict about the health condition by analyzing patient‟s life style, physical health factors, mental health factors and their social network a ctivities. Machine learning algorithms plays an essential role in providing patient centric treatments. Bayesian methods is becoming popular in medical research due its effectiveness in making better predictions.For example on training the model with the age of women and diabetes condition helps to predict the chances of getting diabetes for new women patients without detailed diagnosis.",29

Besides the six compelling reasons which have been cited in the editorial there are two more important issues which call for incorporating basic tenets of Indian System of Medicine in modern medical system. These are: • Ayurveda being a goldmine of herbal medicine provides clue to reverse pharmacology, the present day need for bed to bench research. Three such classical example are Terminalia arjuna which has shown to be an effective therapy for stable angina and coronary artery disease,[2,3] Combination of Withania somnifera and siddh Makardhwaj in rheumatoid arthritis[4] and use of Curcuma domestica (turmeric) as an anti-inflammatory agent.[5] Needless to mention that having dried up other sources of discovering new molecules it is high time that we focus our attention towards our own plant based drugs. Council of Scientific and Industrial Research had done commendable job in preparing a digital library of such herbs.[6] How can we achieve this objective without sensitizing our students towards basic pharmacognostical and pharmacological properties of few important plants • The worsening health scenario due to surging epidemic of noncommunicable diseases which cannot be managed alone by allopathic system of medicine. Leave alone curing the acute episodes of most of these totally preventable diseases; lot is desired to emphasize about the need for the holistic approach for their prevention. Looking at the root cause of these maladies one can easily make out that there is lot of synergy between the healthy life style as advocated by Indian System of Medicine and current day recommendations of many professional bodies both national as well as international[3] • Further, it is high time that we include yoga in MBBS course. Association of Physicians of India has already taken a humble step in this direction by incorporating this in its text book of Medicine.[7] Similarly cardiological society of India has come out with a “consensus document” recommending yoga for managememt of hypertension and other cardiovascular diseases.[3] Conceptually Ayurveda and Unani both take holistic view of most of the current health problems. However, the fact that these streams of medicine were conceived many centuries ago and have not been subjected to rigorous scientific scrutiny; they do need ratification by evidence based research using modern tools of investigations. It needs no over emphasis that our Asian neighbors like China, Vietnam and Sri Lanka have already gone ahead with integration of their traditional medicine with modern allopathic system. Why can’t we move in this direction. Fortunately we now have three premier institutions, one at Banaras (Banaras Hindu University), another at Aligarh (Aligarh Muslim University) and third at Jamia Hamdard, New Delhi which have modern medical colleges as well as Ayurvedic/Unani undergraduate courses running under the same roof. These three premier Institutes can be asked to develop a model of conducting integrated courses which can be later on applied all over India in phased manner. This suggestion needs due consideration.",19

","Much work has been done on recommender systems (RS) and much evidence was collected from applications about their effectiveness on business. As a consequence, the use of RS has quickly shifted from information retrieval to automatic marketing tools. The main aim of marketing tools is to positively affect customersâ€™ purchasing decisions and we know through marketing literature that purchasing decisions are strongly influenced by price. However, few works have explored the issue of including price in a recommendation engine. In this paper, we want to describe the main issues of designing this type of price-sensitive recommendation engine. We want also to demonstrate what the effect is of this design on recommendationsâ€™ accuracy and on business performance. We demonstrate that including price in an RS improves the accuracy of recommendations, but it has to be properly modeled in order to also improve business performance. We have experimented with a Price-Sensitive RS in a laboratory setting and compared it to a traditional one by varying several settings.

","ABSTRACT Consumer psychology and consumer behaviour has constantly been a field of interest for the researchers. Volumes of researches are available in this area, still new theories and concepts keep emerging in response to change in context and environment. Consumer psychology has large cross disciplinary implications. In this paper, a relationship between consumer psychology and recommender system has been explained and how implementing a consumer psychology model can improve recommender system performance. This paper also gives first level analysis of various filters that can be developed along with the design of recommender system in order to generate a more refined and relevant choice sets. There are attraction effects observed among different items and the attractiveness of a product is codependent on attractiveness of other options available in a choice set. In the present paper, we have explored the utility of defender model in the design of recommender systems. Different effects like decoy and asymmetric dominance are also analyzed to achieve better efficiency and effectiveness in the design of recommender system. Keywords: Decoy, Recommender, Defender Model, Asymmetric Dominance INTRODUCTION Recommender systems are the category of information systems which supports searching and suggesting products and services according to user's requirement and preferences (Resnick et al., 1997). The product range may vary from consumer durables such as a book in Amazon or digital goods such as song on lastfm. The task of recommending products proactively is performed by recommender systems which work backstage on E-commerce websites. Many recommendation approaches and methods are applied to target internet based consumers. Collaborative filtering was earliest approach to create user to user similarity and then recommend similar products. Recommendation approach was simple. Positively rated items by one set of user were recommended to similar users. However, this 'user to user' correlation lead to scarce data and cold start problems (Ahn, 2008). This problem was targeted by designing an 'item to item' based correlation and this category of algorithms were termed as content based filtering as volume of data available for products was much denser than user data. There were some specialized variations also for example demographic or knowledge based recommender system which includes domain based knowledge to analyze user preference and predict user choices. As it is evident that recommender system directly interact with consumer and for establishing a better communication it is essential that recommender systems should be intelligent enough to understand consumer's behavioral traits(Pu et al., 2011). Understanding consumer psychology and its phenomenon will actually present meaningful insights to improve recommendations and effectiveness of these systems which in turn can be translated into economical benefits. The purpose of the recommender system is not only to elicit preference and produce accurate search results but also to improve the decision making in an ecommerce context (Xiao et al., 2007). A good amount of research in the recommender system focuses on developing complex algorithms and software programs which improves the efficiency of recommender systems (Cosley et al., 2003). However, there is a need to identify other significant aspects which attempts to maximize the value derived from a recommender system experience (Xiao et al., 2007). Factors such as trust on online medium (Yaobin et al., 2007) and personal choices (Ho et al., 2008) are often ignored in the design and implementation process. .In the present paper, we propose a conceptual framework based on established theories from the field of consumer psychology. The proposed framework allows the systems designer to incorporate the significance of derived value of a given product/service in order to achieve the single most important objective of any decision behaviour-maximizing utility. …",7

","Recommender systems (RSs) have become a familiar artifact in cyberspace 
as a vehicle for increasing revenues while deepening customer loyalty and satisfaction. 
Typically RS are developed in house by companies with a large product line and customer 
base. However, the structure of RS is often straightforward, and effective systems 
can be developed at relatively low cost, and thus offered as a marketing service. 
We discuss the anatomy of a specific recommender system designed for a telecommunication 
carrier which uses predictive analytics in the form of collaborative filtering techniques 
to recommend products to users. Collaborative filtering (CF) is based upon the premise 
that users who have purchased a particular product will have similar preferences 
to other users who also purchased the product. We discuss and compare three versions 
of a CF-based recommender system based upon customer purchase history, customer 
browsing history, and user segments respectively. The results in terms of increased 
sales suggest that RS offer substantial value as a mobile marketing service. We 
suggest ways in which RS can be generalized into RS generators for more rapid development 
and deployment. We then invert the RS perspective from product-centric to user-centric 
and suggest how this would work in customer targeting for mobile advertising campaigns. 
We conclude that RS in the largest sense are heavily model-feedback in nature and 
require increasingly sophisticated automated modeling and predictive analytics capabilities 
layered on a scalable big data infrastructure.",19

","The paper describes an application of indexing—the technology currently widely used for processing and comparing textual information—to multi-dimensional entities of knowledge domains. We propose a model for building a frame-based ontology, which contains a domain conceptual model as well as a controlled vocabulary of ""base terms"" used for indexing. Further, the ontology constitutes the structure for the knowledge base of the recommender system developed by us, whose task is to support human- computer interaction in web applications. The system automatically represents the interaction task being solved as a structured set of base terms, and compares it with the pre-indexed design guidelines representing practical knowledge of the domain. The interaction task context is defined by input data: 1) semi-structured attributes of target users and 2) natural-language requirements for a particular web application. The former are processed mostly via production model rules stored in the knowledge base, while the requirement text is mined for base terms from the controlled vocabulary. As a result of the comparison, the system provides a set of guidelines relevant for a particular interaction task context, seeking to save work effort of interface designers. Also, the proposed approach for indexing multi-dimensional entities can be applied in various recommender and knowledge-based systems.",24

","Summary Recommender systems in the last decade opened new interactive channels between buyers and sellers leading to new concepts involved in the marketing strategies and remarkable positive gains in online sales. Businesses intensively aim to maintain customer loyalty, satisfaction and retention; such strategic longterm values need to be addressed by recommender systems in a more tangible and deeper manner. The reason behind the considerable growth of recommender systems is for tracking and analyzing the buyer behavior on the one to one basis to present items on the web that meet his preference, which is the core concept of personalization. Personalization is always related to the relationship between item and user leaving out the contextual information about this relationship. User's buying decision is not only affected by the presented item, but also influenced by its price and the context in which the item is presented, such as time or place. Recently, new system has been designed based on the concept of utilizing price personalization in the recommendation process. This system is newly coined as personalized pricing recommender system (PPRS). We propose personalized pricing recommender system with a novel approach of calculating consumer online real value to determine dynamically his personalized discount, which can be generically applied on the normal price of any recommend item through its predefined discount rules.",33

","Marketing information systems are those systems which make the gathering, processing, selection, storage, transmission and display of coordinated and continuous internal and external information. Includes systematic and formal methods used for managing all of an organization's information market. Recommendation systems are those systems that are widely used in online systems to suggest items that users might find interesting. These recommendations are generated using in particular two techniques: content-based and collaborative filtering. This paper aims to define a new system, namely Marketing Recommender System, a system that serves marketing and uses techniques and methods of the digital economy.Keywords: Marketing Recommender Systems, Information Systems, Database, Consumer Environment1 IntroductionMarketing Information System is a set that makes the gathering, processing, selection, storage, and transmission, coordinated and continuous display of internal and external information.It consists of specialists, equipment and procedures for collecting, sorting, analysis, evaluation and distribution of necessary information, correctly and on time, to the decision makers in marketing.One of the most important international conferences in recommendation systems, organized by the ACM, presents as a summary of all research definitions, the definition of recommendation systems:""Recommender systems are software applications that aim to support users in their decision-making while interacting with large information spaces. They recommend items of interest to users based on preferences they have expressed, either explicitly or implicitly.The ever-expanding volume and increasing complexity of information on the Web has therefore made such systems essential tools for users in a variety of information seeking or ecommerce activities. Recommender systems help overcome the information overload problem by exposing users to the most interesting items, and by offering novelty, surprise, and relevance"" [11].Through this paper we define a new concept namely Marketing Recommender System, as a system that links marketing information system and recommendation systems.2 Consumer Environment and its AnalysisWhy knowing the consumer environment?Customer shall not be considered the last link of the chain of the movement of goods. The most important strong point of a business is continuous relationship with the client.Marketers need to claim legitimately that they understand deeply, as it appears, developing and matures such a relationship.Even if there is a tendency to delegate responsibility to the level of individual employee, relationship with the client, understanding and interpretation remains an attribute of marketing specialist.Those who sell must focus on what they want to sell, on what customers want to buy, and must take into consideration that costumers desires are always changing.So, what customers want? The answer is relatively simple.They buy to satisfy a particular need or desire. The problem is, however, one of the most complex, because the needs are many and various, from the basic, essential for survival and common to all, and ending with the need to satisfy the need for respect of others or to obtain intellectually and spiritually satisfactions.The active marketing requires start preparing for the new conditions and it's clear that a change in the consumer environment will have significant influence on the future resources of the company. It is very important for marketers to adopt a system of evaluation of the consumer environment, based on:. observation of the environment;. significant changes in environmental inventory;. forecasting and building scenarios for future action;. analyze the potential effect of changing the company's ability to satisfy customers.By identifying the priority of future actions, we can create and keep profitable customers. …",19

","Researchers have shown the importance of trust in numerous domains such as e-commerce, technology acceptance, strategic alliances, and virtual teams. They emphasize the importance of creating insights on trust building for deriving effective design implications for technical systems or organizations. Until now, most researchers have viewed trust as a single construct and did not separately study the trust relationships between different stakeholders in a single study. We argue that the trust relationships between different stakeholders need to be studied separately in order to derive more precise and effective design implications. Thus, this paper aims at opening up the trust black box, and identifying the importance of different trust relationships a user is engaged in when using a recommender system. To achieve this, we address two research questions: a) What are the different trust relationships existent when using a recommender system? and b) How important are the different trust relationships regarding a user’s intention to use a recommender system in the future? To answer these research questions, we first build upon trust networks for the Human Computer Interaction community to identify the different trust relationships existent in recommender system usage, after which we use a laboratory experiment to gather empirical insights on the importance of the different trust relationships. The results of the laboratory experiment show that the users’ trust in the system itself and in the designers of the system both have the a high impact on users’ perceived usefulness and their intention to use the recommender system in the future. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to investigate the importance of different trust relationships prevalent in recommender system usage, and to introduce trust networks to trust research in management and IS research.",7

","Demand for context-aware systems continues to grow due to the diffusion of mobile devices. This trend may represent good market opportunities for mobile service industries. Thus, context-aware or location-based advertising (LBA) has been an interesting marketing tool for many companies. However, some studies reported that the performance of context-aware marketing or advertising has been quite disappointing. In this study, we propose a novel context-aware recommender system for LBA. Our proposed model is designed to apply a modified collaborative filtering (CF) algorithm with regard to the several dimensions for the personalization of mobile devices – location, time and the user’s needs type. In particular, we employ a classification rule to understand user’s needs type using a decision tree algorithm. We empirically validated the effectiveness of the proposed model by using a real-world dataset.

Based on the background of the mobile industry, this paper proposes the framework and process of a mobile service recommendation. The customer value hierarchy-based customer demand analysis is used. Firstly, a contour model of customer value hierarchy is obtained by investigation and specific interview; secondly, the significant attributes of customer value layers are screened out; then a customer demand discrimination model is built where the customer demand objective layer is the output of the model and the customer demand attribute layer is its input. A well-formed model can dynamically identify the customer demand objectives from their engagement history record; finally, a personalized product recommendation is made. This model is used for the analysis of mobile customer samples. The results of customer demand discrimination reflect its outcome with the correct percentile exceeding 80%.

","—This paper propose an efficient recommend-er system using collaborative filtering mechanism with k-separability approach for web based marketing. We follows the collaborative recommender method in which a user rating is aggregation of various characters using matrix but dataset becomes very noisy and difficult to separate. So, the K-Separability approach extends linear separability of data clusters into k>2 segments on the discriminating hyperplane. It can be implemented by single layer or 2-layer perceptron. K-Separability is able to uncover complex statistical dependencies i.e. positive or negative. Finally, We don't need to filter the neighborhood of the target filter as other systems. All neighborhoods are considered and extremely useful in case of sparse dataset.",40
